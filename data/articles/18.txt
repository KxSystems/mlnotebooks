ABILA, Kronos - In a touching ceremony Wednesday leaders of the activist group Protectors of Kronos paid tribute to their fallen leader, Elian Karel, who was murdered on 19 June 2009 while being illegally detained in a Kronos jail.
"Today we gather to remember Elian Karel," Silvia Marek told the rapt assembly, many of whom held up white candles in Karel's honor.
"Elian was born on an Elodis farm not 40 minutes from here, to Jeroen and Antaura Karel.  He grew up with the specter of death all around him.   By the time Elian was 17 many of his family members and friends were battling constant illness, including his neighbor 10-year old Juliana Vann."
Marek paused a moment to allow the cries of "Remember Juliana!" to fade.
"Elian devoted his life to the people of Elodis as well as all citizens of Kronos, as did his father before him.  Elian knew his would be a difficult journey.  He had watched his father, Jeroen and the founder of the POK, Henk Bodrogi walk the very path he would tread.  Elian knew the course would not be easy, and would leave little time for a personal life.  Yet he chose to take those steps despite the challenges he knew he would face."
"Elian's journey ended three years ago today.  But his dream did not die with him.  And it is that vision of a healthy and prosperous future for all we are here today to honor."
Over the course of the afternoon several other speakers paid tribute to not only Elian, but all who have been victims of the environmental catastrophe brought about by greed and corruption of public officials. 
The gathering was marred only by the aggravating presence of Abila police in riot gear.  The police agitated many of the crowd, causing them to have to leave the assembly rather than be assailed with batons and pepper spray.
