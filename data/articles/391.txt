Abila, Kronos - A measure to increase taxes on foreign oil and gas development proposed by Minister of Health Cesare Nespola was defeated by a wide margin last week in the General Assembly. 

This defeat is a harsh blow to the Protectors of Kronos, an Elodis group that was counting on this funding to provide healthcare and environment cleanup of their drinking and irrigation water. 

"We have a meeting planned with the Minister," Protectors of Kronos leader Henk Bodrogi told the Homeland Illumination. 

Bodrogi is the leader of the Protectors of Kronos, a grassroots environmental group with a mission to reverse the pollution caused by gas drilling in his hometown.
