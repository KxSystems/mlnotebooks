   Thursday, June 14,  2001 Issue 30   EDITORIAL  Putting the  brakes on Re=
gulations   The past few weeks have brought home the reality of  just what =
sort of environment energy companies are working in.  For all the talk abou=
t deregulation across the globe, it's  become increasingly apparent that go=
vernments aren't quite  willing to give up their control over energy supply=
 and  distribution.    In Europe, EDF's expansion plans have been put on th=
e hot  seat by various governments not too thrilled about the idea of  the =
French company becoming a major player in their backyards.  Enron's recent =
problems in India only serve to highlight that  while Asia remains an impor=
tant place for investment,  governmental red tape remains a major impedimen=
t. The  Brazilian energy crisis has brought the Brazilian government  back =
into the mix with a vengeance. And in the US, California  is having a fine =
time going after a number of energy companies  on charges of price fixing. =
It would seem that the energy  companies can't catch a break wherever they =
term (even mother  nature seems to be having fun at their expense with the =
recent  flooding in Houston with my namesake Tropical Storm Allison).    It=
's not all doom and gloom however. Record profits and  investment in the en=
ergy stocks only go to show that the  energy industry is a resilient lot.  =
  --Allison Robertshaw, Editor      CASE STUDY  Latin America and the Energ=
y  Economy  The dawn of the 21st  Century signals a shift in Latin America =
to an "Energy  Economy". However, the pathway to the new economy is plagued=
  with potholes in the form of political unrest, decades of poor  planning,=
 hydroelectric projects on the verge of drying up, on  again-off again dere=
gulation efforts, and impending gloom in  some power sectors.  In spite of =
many headlines  pronouncing doom and gloom there are many bright spots on  =
Latin America's energy horizon. As the old saying goes "there  are many ros=
es among the thorns". Not the least of those roses  is the sector's abundan=
t oil and gas reserves, estimated at  some 137 billion bbl... Click here fo=
r Full Story       FOCUS  The Sun Rises On Alternative  Energy  The winds o=
f change are  blowing in the energy sector, particularly in the field of  r=
enewable energy. Renewables, especially solar are set to grow  dramatically=
 over the near term as the industry comes to grips  with the depletion of f=
ossil fuels and the power shortages  plaguing much of the globe.  The renew=
able energy  sector is expected to grow as much as 28.5% per year over the =
 next five years according to reliable sources. It should be  noted however=
, that renewables are not expected to be a major  threat to conventional oi=
l and gas as most of the world and  virtually all of the industrialized... =
Click here for Full Story        INSIGHT  Preparing for the (Uncertain)  Fu=
ture  Technological advances,  along with increased merger activity, clearl=
y have increased  the complexity of the energy industry dramatically during=
 the  past decade. Complicating the scenario is the fact that energy  manag=
ers are more accountable to shareholders and shareholder  value than ever. =
The change has been tremendous. In upstream  E&P, for example, the concept =
of the customer, much less  shareholder value, didn't exist five years ago.=
 Toward this  end, a company's ability to present itself in a good light is=
  paramount; to do so requires a reasonable ability to predict  company per=
formance in the near  future.  Headquartered in London, Celerant  Consultin=
g  (formerly Cambridge Management Consulting)  helps oil and gas companies =
manage these and other challenges  they face. Among the fourteen-year-old c=
