At Enron, we recognize that we are all stakeholders when it comes to the success of our communities. Whether we give back to communities with our time, talents or treasures is not the issue; rather, it is simply that we give. 

Making Connections - We've Gone Paperless!
Community Relations has been working hard to help make giving and volunteering easier for Enron employees. Today, we are proud to launch an updated Community Relations web-site including paperless matching gift and volunteer incentive programs! Visit the site at cr.enron.com <http://cr.enron.com>.

The new CR site includes:
?	Matching Gift Program Information
?	Volunteer Incentive Program Information
?	Regularly Updated Volunteer Sign-up Information
?	Enron In Action
?	Corporate Giving
?	Education Programs

Win A $1000 Donation To Your Favorite Charity
If you donate to an eligible non-profit Tuesday July 17 through Tuesday, July 31 and use the on-line Matching Gift site located at cr.enron.com, your name will automatically be entered into a drawing for a chance for Enron to donate $1000 to the charity of your choice! Five employee's names will be drawn and winners will be notified by Friday, August 3.  Donations must be made to organizations that are eligible to be matched by the Enron Matching Gift Program.
