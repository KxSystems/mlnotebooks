Joannie: Thank you very much. I appreciate Jeff giving me a few minutes out of his busy schedule (May 24 at 3:00 p.m.). Here are some questions that are pertinent for our discussion. 

Are there two or three experiences you look back on having been especially valuable in helping develop your leadership style? Why did you find them valuable?

How have your views on leadership changed over time?

How do you think organizational changes or global changes impact on leadership styles?

What motivates you and how do you motivate others?

Do you ever have time to reflect on your leadership style in a particular instance? if so, what process do you use for evaluation?

What are the most important leadership skills for the energy industry? Does leadership style change for other industries, such as the airline industry or the automobile industry?

I can schedule 15 minutes for you on Thursday, May 31 at 3:00p.  It would be a big help to Jeff if you could submit your questions via e-mail prior to the interview.

Thanks,

In order to prepare a paper for my graduate class on Leadership, I would like to interview you as a leader. Some questions that would be of interest would be what events conspired to bring you to Enron, what developmental process you knowingly (or unknowingly) went through in your early years and what challenges have you encountered that made a significant change in your career.

If you would be amenable and have the time, I would like to interview you sometime next week for about 30-40 minutes. If you wish, I could provide you questions in advance to maximize your time.

Thank you for considering this request.
