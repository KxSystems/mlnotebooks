Dear Mr Skilling,
Following Phil Carroll's letter to you of April 16 I would be delighted to call on you to tell you more about Hakluyt.  While we have already done some work for Enron (Scott Tholan), virtually all our work for our clients is at a strategic level where our coverage of issues is of greatest value.  With your challenging international objectives I am confident we could be of value to you.
If you would find it useful to meet I will contact your office to arrange a suitable time.
Yours sincerely
Christopher James
