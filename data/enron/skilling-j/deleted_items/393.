In order to provide increased focus and greater efficiency to our internati=
onal activities we have formed a new business unit, Enron Emerging Market
Services (EEMS).  This new unit will be headed by Kevin Hannon acting as CE=
O, and Jim Hughes as COO and will report to the Enron Office of the Chairma=
n.  The activities of this unit will consist of all those previous pursued =
by the former Enron Global Assets group, with the exception of those relati=
ng to Dahbol Power Corp (DPC) in India.  Rebecca McDonald will continue to =
manage Enron's ownership interest in DPC and will now also report directly =
to the Enron Office of the Chairman.  In addition, EEMS will also manage al=
l activites formerly residing in Azurix with the exception of Wessex Water =
Company which will continue to report to Stan Horton, CEO Enron Transportat=
ion Services.  Lastly, while EEMS will now manage all wholesale activities =
in the Southern Cone, inclusive of Brazil, significant merchant activity ha=
s, and continues to occur in this region.  For this reason John Lavorato, C=
EO Enron Americas(does name change to North America?) will continue to over=
see all energy risk management activities in Brazil during this period of t=
ransition.  We congratulate Kevin, Jim, and Rebecca on their new assignment=
s.
