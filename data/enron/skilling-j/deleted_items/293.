Dear Mr Jeffrey K Skilling:

When the Netherlands-based World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) scrapped its management-through-committee-oversight policy they had no idea how effective their new system would be.

Using operating groups called Target-Driven Activities (TDA), WWF learned that it is more effective to appoint a program manager and give him or her a budget and a relatively free hand.  "This person is responsible," says Siegfried Woldhek, former head of the Netherlands organization of WWF, "for the 'heart, head, and belly' of a project: the vision, the strategy, the day-to-day management, and the development of the people involved."

The effects have been spectacular, sometimes nearly doubling the results of the former committee method.  Even more interesting are the possibilities that TDA management techniques hold for other, more commercial enterprises...something executives all over the world are beginning to consider.

For more information on TDA management, I suggest that you carefully read the Zealot Profile of Mr. Woldhek in the upcoming issue of strategy+business.

When you do, you will see why strategy+business is so eagerly awaited by the select group of influential senior executives to whom we regularly send complimentary issues.

While we are on the subject, I should mention that our records indicate you have been receiving s+b since Jun 16 00.  There is no reason why you cannot keep receiving strategy+business absolutely free?but it would be best if you make arrangements right now to extend your subscription.
