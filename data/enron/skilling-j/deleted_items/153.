Dear  Jeff:
 
Eyeforenergy  is organizing the upcoming EEO Europe:  Energy Trading in the New Economy  conference for February 21-22, 2002 in Amsterdam.  I'd like to invite you to do a keynote presentation at the event.  We think  Enron's pioneering role in Energy trading would make an ideal case study for the  event and be of great interest to our  delegates.
 
This is the third  event of the series, and the first in Europe.  Past events have pulled in  over 250 delegates and featured speakers from such companies as Shell, BP, Duke,  Aquila, the ICE, NYMEX, Calpine, Altra, Ameren, AES, New Energy, Conoco, the  FTC, Southern, TXU, and Williams among others.  As you can see our events  regularly attract the major players in the energy industry.  (you can take  a look at the line up for our US conference at www.eyeforenergy.com/usa2001 )
 
This year's  European event is going to focus on the convergence of online trading and the  deregulation of the energy market in Europe.  Presentations will be  strategic in nature addressing specific issues and how they are affecting energy  companies' trading strategies.  I've attached a copy of the draft agenda to  give you an idea of the topics we're looking to cover.  Any thoughts on the agenda, the topics, issues  we're missing, or key people you think would be important to have speak at the  conference would be most helpful.
 
To give you a bit of  background, Eyeforenergy is an on- and off-line community for the energy  industry focusing on new strategic and technological advances in the energy  industry.  To serve the community we run conferences, provide daily news, a  bi-monthly newsletter, in-depth reports, free white papers, streamed  presentations and interviews.  You can find out more information or to see  what we do, simply go to www.eyeforenergy.com    
 
Ihope you'll be able  to join us in Amsterdam and let me know if  you have any questions. I'd also  appreciate any comments you might have on our plans--we're always trying to fine  une the program to make sure  t firmly addresses the  needs of the market we're  targeting.  If there's a good time to call when you're back in the  office, please let me know.  Thanks again for your  time.
 
Best,
Allison
