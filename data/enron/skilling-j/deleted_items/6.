EVENTS UPDATE


* Energy Exchanges Online II: Energy Trading in the New Economy

Eyeforenergy is pleased to announce that Enron will be chairing the upcoming

Energy Trading in the New Economy.  From September 10-11, energy traders
will be meeting in New Orleans to discuss the latest developments in online
trading.  Speakers include: Bill Lawson, Director of Strategic Development,

"We've been astounded by the success of this show," remarked Allison
Robertshaw, Director of Eyeforenergy.  "It's a key time for the industry.
We've had a bit of time to take stock of the fall out from deregulation in
places like California and New York.  In addition, it looks like the shake
down among the online exchanges is about to go through another round.  I
think it's an ideal time for energy traders to take a good, hard look at who
they're working with and make sure that they've got the right partners."

2001.
