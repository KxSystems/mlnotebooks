			Good Monday Morning - Comments From The Local Guys!

Very late edition.

According to Jeff Applegate, Lehman Brothers' strategist, the prevailing
bear story on the market is that the market is now lower than it was six
months ago, after the initial Federal Reserve interest rate cut. The
implication is that something must be wrong. Well, one thing that we do know
is that earnings have been declining for the last six months. However,
according to Jeff, that  does not imply that the Fed is powerless. It only
means that memories are short.  In 1981, the same situation prevailed. The
market was down 6%, six months after the initial interest rate cuts from the
Fed. and  again in 1990, the market was down 14% after the same period.
However, Jeff does point out that on average, the S&P 500 was invariably up
18% after the initial Fed. easing. Given that Jeff's target by year end is
only 1450 on the S&P 500, the jury is still out. If the S&P reached that
level, it would only be 8% above the January 3rd level when the Fed. started
their easing process....and that would be at the low end of the historical
range.


The 30-year US T-Bond yield is 5.87%.
The 10-year is trading at 5.17%.
The 5-year is trading at 4.71%.
Spot crude oil is trading at $26.06 p/b.
Natural Gas - Henry Hub -  is trading at $3.06 p/mcf.

			AD Time:

New Federal Insider-Trading Rule (Rule 10b5-1) has been adopted by the SEC
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This rule greatly enhances an
insider's/employee's ability to trade his/her corporate shares during
blackout periods.
Previously, without the protection of this new SEC rule, employees and
insiders could safely trade only outside of designated blackout windows.
Under this new rule, insiders/employees may have the ability to purchase and
sell their corporate shares even during blackout periods if a written plan
was established and in force when the insider/employee was not in possession
of material, non-public information.
The new rule contains other restrictions and should be reviewed carefully.
Lehman Brothers has established a turn-key plan that take into account the
regulatory procedures for establishing such a plan.    Please email us or
call us for more information.

INITIATING COVERAGE

Juniper Networks(JNPR) 3 - Market Perform T. Luke, .212.526.4993
Assuming Coverage; Awaiting Better Visibility; Mkt Perf. (C)
OLD NEW STREET P/E
Price: $28.47 EPS 2000 N/A $0.53 N/A N/A
52 Wk Ra: $245 - 24 EPS 2001 N/A $0.51E $0.53E 55.8

Rank N 3
*We are assuming coverage of core IP routing leader Juniper Networks. While
we are encouraged by JNPR's impressive comp
positioning as a strong tech leader in key l-term growth market, we see few
n-term catalysts for shares w/ visibility limited amidst
current telecom cap ex slowdown. Rating 3 Market Perform
*We believe JNPR remains a core routing tech leader with a world class
product line, over 500 service provider custs, and a strong,
experienced mgmt team operating with high gross margins & good cash flow in
a mkt with high barriers to entry.
*On July 12, JNPR reported 2Q01 results in line w/ recently reduced
guidance. Rev of $202M & EPS of $0.09. GM was 60.2%.
Book to Bill>1.
*Our CY01 & CY02 rev & EPS ests are $944M & $1B & $0.51 & $0.53,
respectively. Against a backdrop of weaker carrier
spending, flattish sales over the next several q's, and heightened
competitive focus f/ CSCO we see few catalysts for shares beyond
$29-$32, or 55-60x CY02 ests.
