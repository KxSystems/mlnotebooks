Do you ever get the feeling that the idea you posted into the Idea Vault isn't looked at by anyone or going anywhere?  Well, listen to this.  Steve Gullion, EES IT manager, deposited an idea about economic data derivatives.  And guess what?  The Xcelerator liked the idea so much that they are now working on a business plan.  
Go to the Thinkbank (http://nahou-lnapp01.corp.enron.com/eThink/Thinkbank.nsf/HomePage?OpenPage) now and post the idea that has been brewing in your brain!


We've all heard Jeff Skilling say we need to "earn our way out" of the current Enron share price slump.  One way we can accomplish this is by doing a better job of managing company expenses.  Ask Kevin Hannon, CEO of Enron Global Asset Services and Policy Committee member, all your questions about how we can earn our way out, together.  Tuesday, June 19 on eSpeak at 10 a.m. Houston time.

Can't make the live event?  No worries.  Go to eSpeak (http://ethink.enron.com/eSpeak/exec/default.asp) now and submit your question.  Kevin will try to answer it during his event and you can read the transcript later.


After Kevin's eSpeak, we'll be opening a category in  eMeet http://nahou-lnapp01.corp.enron.com/eThink/eMeet.nsf called "Cost Savings Initiatives" so you can continue talking amongst yourselves and helping Enron save.  (And if you've got some great cost saving ideas, don't forget you can put them into the Idea Vault in the ThinkBank!)
