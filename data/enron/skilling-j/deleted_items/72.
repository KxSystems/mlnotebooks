Dear HBS Alumni:
Continue to capture the benefits of HBS by joining the Harvard Business School Club of Houston!
The HBS Club is dedicated to providing alumni a broad range of programs.  Members will have the opportunity to network and establish friendships with other Harvard alumni and learn about current issues from business, government and faculty speakers.  Also this year we are establishing a program with the Houston Annenberg Challenge, a non-profit public school reform organization.  To address the different schedules and objectives of alumni, this year we will be offering programs before, during and after work including fun social events where you can bring your spouse or a guest.
The program for this year promises to be the most diverse and exciting the club has sponsored. Over 40 events are planned with five different programs:
     1.  Breakfast Club                 
     2.  Luncheon Speakers              
     3.  Monthly Mixers
     4.  Charity Events (New!)
     5.  Social Events
     See our updated website for more information  www.hbshouston.org 
Some of the events being planned include: 
   -  Linda Clarke, Exec. Director Houston Annenberg Challenge - September 5th Luncheon
