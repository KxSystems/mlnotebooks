Greetings!  All's well today as we finally see sunshine in Houston.

Meanwhile, I thought you would enjoy hearing Texas A&M University hosted
reception last Thursday, celebrating our J.V. in the Lockard & White
Learning Center.  Actual market requests helped define classes developed
specifically for telecom, utilities, and energy firms - also, take a
peek at www.lwlc.com.

These courses, designed based on requests from U.S. companies, fulfill a
market need for professional training in the telecommunications arena.
It is a Win-Win program in which all benefit from better trained
professionals and industry leaders.

We look forward to exploring with you ways in which we may partner
on domestic U.S. and international initiatives as well.

Regards,  -
