Dear Mr. Skilling,

Good day to you!  I believe our companies may have a fit for a possible working relationship.  My name is Gayle Johnson and I am with Working Solutions (www.workingsol.com).  We are a virtual service management company and specialize in contact center management, including:  voice, e-mail, chat, fax, and VOIP, using home-based agents.  Our virtual community of educated, experienced agents is highly scalable, providing solutions for peak demand, high spike call volumes and short notice applications.

We currently have over 11,000 agents, speaking 35 languages, who have been tested and their experience level/skill sets have been logged.  We have a different model that eliminates the benefit load, infrastructure costs, and bricks/mortar issues of a traditional contact center by using our network of agents.  We also utilize your existing technology infrastructure to keep all reporting and management functions consistent within your organization.

If you'd like to consider outsourcing customer care, tech support agents, etc., I know we have a quality, cost-effective solution for you.

At your request, I can send you a two page overview of our company.

I look forward to exploring this possibility with you.

Sincerely,
Gayle Johnson
