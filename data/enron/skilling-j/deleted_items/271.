 Dear Jeffrey K., Dear (Name):
I regret that you were not able to join us on Ventaso's web seminar about bringing your brand to the point of sale. We would like to invite you to view the web session at your leisure.
 
During this session, Mark Izumi, Vice President of Marketing and Corporate Communication at Fujitsu, talked about selecting Ventaso's solution for building brand equity through direct and indirect sales channels. 
Ventaso's business is increasing your revenues by making your sales and marketing organizations more effective. That is why our customers, including Mark, look to us to provide a marketing platform that provides a quick and measurable ROI by increasing sales effectiveness in a 1-to-1 selling environment. 
Over time we have developed a marketing methodology based on best practices that helps you craft value messaging to support the solution sell. Our technology enables your sales channels to personalize that messaging - building a business case for each customer's unique buying criteria. 
Our goal at Ventaso is to help you stay ahead of the competition by increasing revenue from all sales channels and enhancing the impact of your brand message at the point of sale.
We look forward to the opportunity to learn more about your challenges and demonstrate how the Ventaso Solution addresses your unique situation. 
Sincerely,
