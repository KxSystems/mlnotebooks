Jeff - 

In our Monday meetings with Carol and David, you asked me to clarify/follow up on Ken Rice's actual sales vs. plan filings.  Per Elaine Overturf, since early 2001, he has filed 2 plans to sell a total of 1.2 million shares.  He sold 253,000 shares.  He terminated one plan and the second appears to have expired only partly fulfilled.  This is internal info and I do not plan to followup with David or Carol.
