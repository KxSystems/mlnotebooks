Mr. Lay-

I recently attended TVA's June Board meeting where the TVA Board tentatively approved a transaction with EGM to demonstrate an innovative, new NOx reduction technology (NOxTech) to which EGM holds the exclusive, world-wide license.  While there, I met Mr. Glen McCullough, one of the TVA Directors.  He asked me to send his best wishes to you.

Although the technology has been tested on a small-scale,  this would be the first full-scale installation.  Our demonstration with TVA should be completed in early 2002 and if successful,  we plan to market it as an alternative to Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) to reduce NOx from coal-fired generation. 

TVA seems excited about the prospect of teaming with Enron to demonstrate this new NOx reduction technology.
