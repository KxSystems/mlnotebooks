Ashley

I suggest that a meeting with you be scheduled to discuss an alternative
severance proposal as your package does not reflect the life-threatening
illness that I contracted while working for Enron in Nicaragua nor does it
appear to take into consideration many other issues such as the difficulty
of obtaining a comparable position at my age.  Please call me today to set
up a meeting with you at a location other than the office.
