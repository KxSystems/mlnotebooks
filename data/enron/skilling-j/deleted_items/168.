Mr. Skilling, by studying Enron I've concluded that you, its driving force, are an adventurer at heart, one who loves new ideas, discovering and exploring new worlds of thought, and taking the untried path rather than the proven, overly-traveled one.  That is why I am reaching out to you personally.
As you know, the world is now one huge marketplace uniting many different cultures, attitudes and beliefs.  Never before in the history of the world has there been a greater need for people to embrace diversities with an understanding that our differences can work together to produce profound advantages for all if only we will learn the art of tolerance, acceptance and understanding.  And what company is better qualified to carry this message than the culturally-diverse and wildly-successful workforce of Enron?
I would like to work with Enron in a public relations capacity, traveling throughout the nation and abroad, educating the public about the dangers of intolerant attitudes and sharing the success story of Enron as a lesson in the value of unity.
May I meet with you briefly to discuss my idea, which I am confident will not only improve the lives of those hearing and receiving the message, but will also serve as an excellent investment of public relations dollars for Enron?
I may be reached by telephone at 281-443-2446 or by e-mail at bnreine@yahoo.com .   I hope to hear from you very soon.
Thank you,
Carla D. Harris
