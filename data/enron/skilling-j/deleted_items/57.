Directions to the Moore's house:
From near I-10 on the West side of town, take I-10 East to the Durham/Shepherd exit, stay on the feeder road and head to the stop light at Durham.  At the Durham intersection take a right onto Durham.  Durham will converge with Shepherd and become Shepherd.  Stay on Shepherd over Memorial Drive.  **Go through the light at W. Dallas.  At the next intersection with a traffic light, the name of the cross street will be West Gray on your left; on your right it will be Inwood.  Take a right onto Inwood.  Go through the four way stop at Chilton; we are the second house on the right, 2410 Inwood Drive.  If you get to Kirby you have gone too far.
From downtown, take I-10 West to the Patterson/Durham/Shepherd exit, stay on the feeder road and go past Patterson and Shepherd and then take a left onto Durham and follow the directions above at the double asterisk (**).
From other points west, take Westheimer, San Felipe or U.S. 59 towards downtown and exit at or turn onto Kirby.  You will be making a left onto Kirby.  Stay on Kirby until you reach the light at Inwood.  There, take a right onto Inwood.  We are the second house on the left from the end of the block.  If you get to Chilton, you have gone too far.
From Memorial or Woodway, head towards downtown and take the Shepherd exit off of Memorial (Note:  Woodway converges into Memorial).  Take a right (i.e. head south), cross over the Buffalo Bayou bridge, and at the light on the other side of the bridge go straight, which will put you on Shepherd.  Follow the directions above at the double asterisk (**).
From north side of town, take I-45 South, head towards downtown, take the Allen Parkway exit, which is a left-hand exit off of I-45 and stay on Allen Parkway until it ends at the stoplight at the Shepherd bridge (on the other side of the bridge the road becomes Kirby).  Take a left at the light, which will put you on Shepherd; do not go straight onto Kirby.  At the first light on Shepherd (only a block away), take a right onto Chilton and stay on Chilton until you reach the four-way stop at Inwood.  There, take a right onto Inwood.  We are the second house on the right, 2410 Inwood Drive.
From south side of town, take I-45 North towards downtown, as you travel beside downtown, you should be in the far left-hand lane.  Take the Allen Parkway exit, which is a left-hand exit off of I-45 and stay on Allen Parkway until it ends at the stoplight at the Shepherd bridge (on the other side of the bridge the road becomes Kirby).
