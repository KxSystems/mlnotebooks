On another note, as a worldwide activity, our resid business is up $12 million this year, and it is something on which we clearly need to focus.  We have a poor history as a company in this area, but it is a business we know is important to our success.  You'll hear more about our additional resources in marketing and risk management in this area.

Have a great weekend.

Jeff
