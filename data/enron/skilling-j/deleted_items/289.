Thank you for taking  the time to discuss the Xcelerator again this morning.  I am excited about  the prospect of joining the team, and am confident that I can help you to grow  some great new businesses.  (Greg Whalley and I spent a couple of hours  discussing it this evening.)  With some changes in place that I've proposed  to David Oxley, I'd be ready to help you and the team open this new chapter for  Enron.  Please let me know if you have any questions or  comments.
 
Thanks  again.
 
Heath
