Jeff,

it's been a while since our meeting at the Portfolio Grand Slam Event in
may... but i wanted to brief you on an effort we brought to you guys viz
making a market in private equity.

originally began the conversation with Lou Pai, but since his departure
we've been engaged with ford cooper and health scheisser in the xcelerator
group.  ford's had numerous conversations with the relevant internal enron
folks.  we've helped confidentially engage some external players/experts in
the venture/private equity space.

initial progress looks promising.

all the best,
clay
