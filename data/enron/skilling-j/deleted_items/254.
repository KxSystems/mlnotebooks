Jeff -- 

Tomorrow at 3 p.m., you are scheduled for a one hour interview with James Thompson, a freelance writer working for the quarterly NY Stock Exchange Magazine.  The editors would like the story to focus on how we go about applying our business model to new markets, including how we decide what markets to pursue.  I have also asked Mike McConnell to provide a global markets perspective.  I think the story will probably lean on your personality and leadership style as well.  Because it is a NYSE publication, we get to read it first. 

Please let me know if you have questions.  Otherwise, I'll see you at 3 p.m.

Thanks

Vance Meyer
