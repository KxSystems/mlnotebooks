There's something about cycling that brings out the best.....and here's a couple of great examples of the very best.....Ansel Michaels and his valiant, successful attempt to do the distance, and Charles Delacey's desire to help make that journey less painful for Ansel.  I hope you find it in your hearts to salute the efforts of each of them by offering your support.  

Charles is a member of Team Enron and was the first rider in to LaGrange this year, arriving 11:15 am.  Please read the following, and if you have questions, his e-mail is Charles.Delacey@enron.com, telephone: 713-853-5757.  THANK YOU!

Subject:	Ansel Michaels/MS150

Ansel Michaels is a 15-year-old freshman at Lamar High School.  Ansel swims on the Lamar swim team and this year, for the first time, joined his swimming teammates on the 2001 MS 150.  Ansel is a paraplegic and rides a hand crank bike in which he is seated and pedals with his arms.  On the first day into LaGrange, Ansel suffered two blowouts and still managed to ride 93 miles before being asked to stop by support crews.  Sunday morning, he was back in the saddle and finished all 72 miles in time to catch the final bus back to Houston.  

Ansel pedaled a hand crank bike that was more suited to going around the block than to Austin.  The gears did not work properly and his bike made an extremely difficult task harder than it should have been.  Ansel has limited resources and has already talked about how excited he is about riding in general and the MS150 for next year.  I am asking for donations to help Ansel buy a new bike.  A decent hand crank bike costs aprox. $3,000.  Any donations in excess of the cost of the bike will be contributed to the MS Society.  An account has been established at West University Bank and checks should be payable to Ansel Michaels.  Donations can be sent to:

Thanks in advance for your help.
