Jeff, I noticed one of your questions on E Speak today concerned the disposal of waste food from the Energizer.  Coincidentally one of our companies, Custom Feeds, is negotiating with Marriott for the right to collect all of the waste food from their various corporate facilities for processing into animal feed.  This is probably a better solution than giving the food to the homeless since it may not be deemed safe for consumption by health authorities after setting out at room temperature. 

Also regarding Custom Feeds they just signed a 3 year contract to sell 95% of their capacity to a large agricultural feed wholesaler beginning with Custom Feeds first production runs.  This will put Custom Feeds ahead of the projections on which we based the investment.
