Hi Joannie,

We spoke a week or so ago about the following:

Harrah's Entertainment (a new EES customer) will be spending the day in our offices tomorrow.  If Jeff's schedule permits, we'd love to have him stop by conference room 5029 and say hello.  Alternatively, we will be in Suite 8 at Enron Field tomorrow night if by chance he'd like to attend the game.  I know the odds are low, but it doesn't hurt to ask!

We signed a very profitable long-term power deal with Harrah's two months ago and a brief hello from Jeff would go a long way in helping us book additional business.

I've attached our agenda for tomorrow.

Thanks!

Ken
