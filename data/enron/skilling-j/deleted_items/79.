Dear Mr Skilling,

Your office has asked me to outline Hakluyt's services. Rather than fall back on the usual corporate information that we have sent to your people previously, I would say simply this; Hakluyt is what you make of it - it places an unparalleled  private intelligence  network at the personal disposal of senior commercial figures.

The range of deployments we have completed for core clients is wide. In all cases we guarantee complete confidentiality. And, although we work for divisional directors on tactical issues, we have found our most rewarding work in personal dealings with CEOs who wish - for whatever reason - to have a confidential agency at their own disposal. It was this, which prompted Phil Carroll to write to you about us in April as he has found our work of considerable value to him personally.  We look at people and the issues, which often drive them to make the decisions or act as they do.  All our work is unattributable.

Our ability to generate intelligence is as strong in the developed economies as in the emerging markets, and we have operated in every major industrial, trade and service sector. We have operated in 82 countries to date some involving Brussels/European Union related issues. The recent GE/Honeywell incident is a good example of where we could have provided timely, accurate insights into the agenda and thinking in Brussels.


 We also have an association with Kissinger/McLarty Associates for although our work is very different the services we both provide can be complementary.  Our US client base is increasing well but at the same time we wish to remain small and discreet.

I would be delighted to call on to tell you more about our operations and to discuss how we could be of value to you.  If this is of interest perhaps I could get my office to contact yours to look for a convenient time.

Yours sincerely

Christopher James
Managing Director
