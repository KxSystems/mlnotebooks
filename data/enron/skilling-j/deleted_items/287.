Jeff,
Thanks again for yours' and Enron's support of our ride. Our MS 150 Ride was this past weekend. We had 14 riders and 10 volunteers. Our ride is not as big as Houston's ride, there was a rough total of 900 riders and our team was the 5th largest with the top team having 23 riders.  All riders finished with minimal mishaps and no SAGs. We are still awaiting our fundraising totals. Here is a copy of our Team photo. Thanks once again for your support. 

Sincerely,
Ron Girard- Team Enron Midwest
