Jeff,

Having been here at EES for not quite two years, I've come to the realization that Enron doesn't seem to be the right place for me.  As a result, I will be leaving EES effective the end of the month.   I have enjoyed the Enron experience, but as Andy counseled me when I joined, "Enron isn't right for everyone" and I think that applies to me at this point of my career.

I've decided to return to my banking roots, and am mounting a job search in the Houston banking community.  With a little luck, I will find an opportunity to cover the Enron account where I can leverage off my time here. 

Finally, I want to thank you personally for the opportunity that I had here.  I wish you all the best as you and your team tackle the challenges facing Enron.  

See you soon.

Evans
