Jeff:
Just a heads up, I am meeting with Gary Pfeiffer, CFO in a couple of weeks to brief him on discussions we have been having with a team of DuPont managers about a deal that looks a bit like the Lilly deal, DuPont's outsourcing of its Corporate campus, including a number of lab buildings in Wilmington.   

As you remember, we met with Pfeiffer and a few others here on 50 to discuss their risk mgmt strategies around gas....those discussions went nowhere, but we are now back and actively engaged with personnel in his group on this outsource opportunity.  

Doubt he would call, but  I wanted you in the loop.
