Jeff -- 

You are scheduled to do a 30-minute telephone interview today at 2:30 p.m. with Fast Company magazine for an article about teaching.  The underlying premise for the article is that to be an effective leader, you must be an effective teacher within your organization.  The reporter, Chuck Salter, was referred to you by David Garvin at Harvard and by a Portland Oregonian reporter.  Given that you transformed how Enron does business by teaching the organization a new business model, this is an ideal opportunity for you and to highlight our non-traditional culture.  For the article, Chuck is also interviewing top executives at Pepsi, Yellow Warp, National Geographic and the Philadelphia Inquirer.

The interview questions are likely to include the following:

Tell me about the teaching you do at Enron, either formally or informally. What do you teach? Whom do you teach? 
Why is it important to you?
What are the principles that guide your teaching?
What do leaders need to know, think about, and do to be better teachers?
How do you measure or evaluate teaching within a corporation? 
Tell me about someone who has benefited from your teaching. 
Tell me about your favorite teachers and what you learned about teaching from them. 

I will come to your office at 2:30 to place the call.

Thank you.
Karen
