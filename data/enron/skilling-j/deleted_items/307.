RosettaMed, Inc.

RosettaMed is an inovative software company whose business is creating and
marketing products that electronically link patients, physicians and
clinical databases to improve healthcare communications, efficiency,
outcomes, quality and satisfaction.  There is little doubt that nearly all
medical records will become electronic this decade.  Recent reports from the
Institute of Medicine and bills in the US Senate and State legislatures
foretell the coming revolution in clinical documentation.  The previous
decade showed that transitioning to EMRs is painful for physicians and their
organizations.  RosettaMed products will alleviate the pain by enabling
faster, more accurate and complete documentation that supports both higher
quality care and higher reimbursement for the physician.

Windjammer Technologies, Inc.

The Windjammer system is a method for processing and packaging fresh meat at
the meat packer level and then shipping it to retail grocery stores
substantially ready for sale to the public.  Shifting the packaging function
upstream to the packer level is called "case-ready" packaging.  The high
costs associated with processing and re-packaging meat in the back rooms of
retail grocery stores has brought case-ready packaging into high demand.
