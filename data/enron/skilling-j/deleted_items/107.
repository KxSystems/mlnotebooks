Sir,
Thank you for taking questions.

Attached is a presentation which I believe is worth $40M / year with very little capital investment.  With your permission, I'd like to arrange to see you for 15 minutes to present this new venture.  With due respect, Lou Pai has been the only person who has not thought these two products would be a natural progression for Enron.  

If you are willing to discuss further, I would ask Jay Lewis to also attend.

Thank you again,


Gregg Cooper
