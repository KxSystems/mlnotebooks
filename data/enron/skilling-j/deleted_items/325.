> Dear Mr. Skilling:
>
> In follow-up to the Fedex Herb Criscito sent you last week, I have
> attached a PostX secure envelope. It is an airline mileage statement but
> should give you an idea of Enron's client experience with PostX
> technology. The password to decrypt the secure statement is "demo". You
> can view the statement offline or if you are connected, there are links in
> the envelope to relevant websites.  Herb will be calling you tomorrow
> afternoon to talk more about what PostX can do for you.
>
> If you have any questions please contact Herb or give me a call directly.
> I look forward to your reply.

> Best Regards,
