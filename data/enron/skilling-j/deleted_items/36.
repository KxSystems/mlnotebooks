			Good Monday Morning - Comments From The Local Guys!

The focus of attention for the markets this week will be tomorrow's meeting
by the Federal Reserve. According to Lehman Brothers' economists, the
downward revision to second quarter GDP growth into negative territory will
be disturbing to the Fed, as will the sharp drop in the Philadelphia Fed
index in July and the continuing deterioration in stock prices. However, the
markets are seeing evidence that the inventory correction process is coming
to an end. Against this background, they expect the Fed to cut the funds
rate another 25 basis point, to 3.5%.

The 30 -year bond yield is 5.48%.
The 10-year is trading at 4.93%.
The 5-year is trading at 4.49%.
Spot crude oil is trading at $27.52 p/b.
Natural Gas - Henry Hub -  is trading at $3.37 p/mcf.

			AD Time:

New Federal Insider-Trading Rule (Rule 10b5-1) has been adopted by the SEC
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This rule greatly enhances an
insider's/employee's ability to trade his/her corporate shares during
blackout periods.
Previously, without the protection of this new SEC rule, employees and
insiders could safely trade only outside of designated blackout windows.
Under this new rule, insiders/employees may have the ability to purchase and
sell their corporate shares even during blackout periods if a written plan
was established and in force when the insider/employee was not in possession
of material, non-public information.
The new rule contains other restrictions and should be reviewed carefully.
Lehman Brothers has established a turn-key plan that take into account the
regulatory procedures for establishing such a plan.    Please email us or
call us for more information.

IMPACT CALLS

CIENA Corp(CIEN) 3 - Market Perform S. Levy, .212.526.2499
A Fall From Grace (C)
OLD NEW STREET P/E
Price: $28.78 EPS 2000 N/A $0.33 N/A N/A
52 Wk Ra: $151 - 28 EPS 2001 $0.74E $0.61E $0.73E 47.2
Mkt Cap: $9.7B EPS 2002 $1.00E $0.50E $0.99E 57.6
FY: 10/31 Price Target $50 N/A
Rank 1 3
*We are now officially downgrading our rating on CIEN shares to 3-Market
Perform from 1-Strong Buy because even after a
precipitous decline in the share price we do not see the shares providing
any reasonable return for at least the next six months and
believe further downside is possible.
*Assuming CIENA's long-haul DWDM sales decline 20% YoY in FY02, we
anticipate FY02 total sales of $1.80 bil, up 12% YoY vs.
$2.44 bil and 40% YoY gr previously. This translates to CY01 and CY02 sales
of $1.66B and $1.935B (+16%) vs. $1.92B and
$2.65B (+38%) previously.
*We now est FY02 EPS falling to $0.50 from $0.61 in FY01 versus our previous
est of $0.74 and $1.00. This translates to new CY01
and CY02 EPS estimates of $0.52 and $0.59 (+13% YoY) vs $0.77 and $1.10
(+43% YoY) in our previous model.
*In our view, overall potential upside to our current sales forecasts is at
least equally matched by the overall potential downside from
current levels.

FOCUS STOCKS

Specialty Chemicals T. Gerdeman, .312.609.4031
Which Chemical Co.'s Benefit From A Weak U.S. Dollar?
*Given the declining U.S. dollar vs. major foreign currencies, it is
worthwhile to review the geographical sales composition of our
U.S. specialty chemical co.'s. The U.S. dollar has been particularly weak
vis-a-vis the Euro, hence we place disproportionate
weighting on the European component of each respective co.'s sales. Select
co.'s hedge their currency exposure, others have dollar-denominated
int'l. sales, hence it is impossible for us to estimate the exact benefit
for a given co. Directionally, however, we clearly
can develop a sense for the biggest beneficiaries.
*Co.'s possessing the greatest % of sales from Europe, in descending order,
include: OMG, SIAL, CBM, and EC. A weaker dollar
could make them more cost-competitive, boosting sales and EPS.

UnionBanCal Corp(UB) 3 - Market Perform B. Vandervliet, .212.526.8893
Erring on the Side of Caution (A)
OLD NEW STREET P/E
Price: $38.7 EPS 2000 N/A $2.54 N/A N/A

FY: 12/31 Price Target $30 $36
Rank 3 3
*Although we see some positive signs in certain areas we remain particularly
concerned about the credit outlook. We believe our EPS
estimates may be high and plan to update them shortly. UB is rated 3 Market
Perform.
*Following a meeting with the Chief Credit Officer, we remain cautious
regarding the near and intermediate term credit outlook at
UB.
*We believe there will be further credit issues tied to the $1.4B of
non-relationship syndicated exposure and $1.3B communications
and telecom portfolios.
*As most past credit problems were centered in the non-relationship
syndicated, not the broader corporate portfolio, we question
whether the reorientation toward greater consumer exposure, in large part on
a wholesale basis, will add value.
*Due to the market action in the stock and results of our DCF analysis, we
are refining our target price to $36 from $30.

On The Road with Waste Management (A)
OLD NEW STREET P/E
Price: $29.89 EPS 2000 N/A $1.20 N/A N/A

FY: 12/31 Price Target $36 $36
Rank 1 1
*We spent 2 days on the road with WMI senior management. The turnaround
appears to be progressing according to schedule with
management noting (1) comfort with near-term EPS expectations and (2) a
continued belief that WMI, over time, will be successful
in driving margins into line with that of its peers.
*Multiple cost reduction & price based initiatives appear to be on track to
drive the material step-up in margin & EPS expected in 2H
01.
*Mgmt remains comfortable with its ability to drive margins & earnings
higher over the longer-term given numerous opportunities for
operational improvement & continued buy-in by the field regarding cost
reduction/productivity & price based initiatives.
*Mgmt confident in a 2H 01 settlement of the class action suit, but the
process is setting the pace.
*Retaining 2001 & 2002 EPS estimates of $1.33 a $1.70. Reiterate Strong Buy

Cardinal Health(CAH) 1 - Strong Buy L. Marsh, .212.526.5315
ENJOYING THE DRIVE: Perspectives from Analyst Meeting
OLD NEW STREET P/E
Price: $73.57 EPS 2001 N/A $2.07 N/A N/A
52 Wk Ra: $77 - 51 EPS 2002 $2.60E $2.60E $2.59E 28.3
Mkt Cap: $30.7B EPS 2003 $3.12E $3.12E $3.11E 23.6
FY: 6/30 Price Target $83 $83
Rank 1 1
*We continue to recommend purchase of shares of Cardinal, after its
analyst/investor meeting held last Thursday, August 16, and
provide some observations & perspectives.
*Key observations - 1) company did a very good job of building a bottoms-up
model as to how it gets to its top-line (and operating
profit) guidance, by division, in our view. 2) Company's tax rate will
continue to be a positive lever to EPS this year, though an
additional 40-50 basis point reduction, and could also see some further
reduction in FY03.
*In addition, 3) company's CFFO guidance of $800-$900mm could once again
turn out to be nicely conservative, in our view. 4) leads
to company's view of EPS visibilty being "extremely high".
*We would also note, of keen importance, implementation of FAS142 provides
"new world" of acquistion flexibility for CAH, leading
to good possibility of action over next 1-5 months, in our view. Confirm $83
target for well-positioned co., rep. 29x our current C02
cash earnings of $2.85.

Jabil Circuit, Inc(JBL) 2 - Buy L. Miscioscia, .212.526.3472
Weak End Markets Take Their Toll Again
OLD NEW STREET P/E
Price: $22.8 EPS 2000 N/A $0.80 N/A N/A
52 Wk Ra: $68 - 18 EPS 2001 $0.76E $0.76E $0.75E 30.0
Mkt Cap: $4.5B EPS 2002 $0.94E $0.72E $0.91E 31.7
FY: 8/31 Price Target $40 $30
Rank 2 2
*On Wednesday 8/15 of last week we commented on a mid day break-in that
recent checks indicated business at some of our EMS
providers could remain flattish for the remainder of this year, and into
next, and highlighted Jabil as one of these providers.
*After further review we are going to lower our FY02 estimates for Jabil due
to our checks and very slow end market demand. While
we believe Jabil is benefiting from some industry consolidation wins, and
the Marconi ramp, some business is moving away from the
company to lower cost suppliers.
*For FY02 our revenue est moves to $4.5B, up 3% y/y but down from our prior
$5B est, and for EPS to $0.72 vs our prior $0.94. Our
CY02 estimate goes to $0.82 down from $1.09. Our new price target is $30,
down from $40. We retain our 2-Buy rating.

Fleming Companies, Inc(FLM) 1 - Strong Buy M. Adler, .212.526.7146
An Extraordinary Buying Opportunity (A)
OLD NEW STREET P/E
Price: $28.20 EPS 2000 N/A $1.56 N/A N/A
52 Wk Ra: $38 - 10 EPS 2001 $1.96E $1.96E $1.96E 14.4
Mkt Cap: $1.5B EPS 2002 $2.55E $2.55E $2.55E 11.1
FY: 12/31 Price Target $45 $45
Rank 1 1
*Fleming remains, in our opinion, an extremely well-run company with strong
growth prospects, and we believe last weeks drop in
price represents an extraordinary good buying opportunity. Fleming is
currently trading at a 2002 P/E of 11.1 x on our estimate of
$2.55, down from 14.4 x two weeks ago. We re-iterate our 1-Strong Buy
rating, and our $45 price target, and we are maintaining our
FY01 EPS estimates at $1.96 and our FY02 EPS at $2.55.
*On Friday, Fleming announced that it has reached an agreement to settle the
largest of its remaining old lawsuits. We see this as a
positive, and we think the market will agree, once it understands that the
details of the settlement.
*Recent conversations with FLM management indicate that most of the glitches
related to Kmart are being resolved smoothly and that
nothing unusual has occurred given the magnitude of the transition. We
continue to many growth opportunities with non-traditional
customers, and we expect the company to be more aggressive about going after
these opportunities now that Kmart is progressing
smoothly.
