Dear Jeff,
Thank you for asking me to attend, on your behalf, an invitation by the Baker Institute Energy Forum, 
for a presentation and dinner with Ra?l Mu?oz, the new CEO of PEMEX.
As you probably know, he has been my friend for many years and he invited me to fly out today in a PEMEX
plane to Houston.

On a different issue, I was told by Juan Eleck, a good friend of mine, and a member of the Trustees of SMU, of  your
recent appointment as Board Member. Congratulations!!

Best regards,  Jaime _____
