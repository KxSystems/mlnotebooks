An Urgent Message from Dr. Ed Young

Dear church family,
No tragedy has overwhelmed this great city with such depth and breadth
as the flooding we've seen this past week.  Without a doubt, this is a
critical time.  Businesses will recover. The Medical Center will recover.
 The Theater District will recover.?but it's the poorest of the poor?.these
are the people that will find it difficult to recover.  They will suffer
the most.

Sadly we've discovered our city is not prepared for such a crisis.  The
tragedies abound.
These victims are desperately seeking help from agencies of relief like
FEMA, The Red Cross, etc.
Never has there been a time in our city that a need has been so great.

Bottom line: We need you to make a difference.  It's time for vast volunteerism.
 It's time to step up and serve.  Who will stand up and help these thousands
of people in their time of need?
Who will make a difference?

As our church members have gone out into the city in recent days they've
discovered overwhelming circumstances.  We must find a way to stretch our
arms around these needs and make a difference.   How can we make a difference?
 We can't.  But God's people, with God's help can!

Our task is clear:
1. We need to clean up homes
2. We need to discern their needs and provide necessary supplies
3. We need to provide the basic assistance to get them back on their feet
including flooring, refrigerators, fans, bedding?basic necessities.

How will we accomplish this?

First of all, it will require sacrifice from all of us working together.
 Starting immediately, we're asking people (high school & older) to come
join a work team.  If you can help, meet at the church anytime after 8:00
a.m. Wednesday through Saturday.  Bring water, work gloves, a sack lunch,
and dress ready to work.  Each team of ten or so will have a team captain
to lead you.

For more details, call 713.365-8600.

Secondly, our Mayor has asked our church to coordinate corporate and private
initiatives in the city to adopt families in need, create a link to individual
home owners (non-insured) or residents of an entire city block.  Already
Conoco, Enron, and Gallery Furniture have joined the effort.  We're praying
for more to step up to the plate.

Finally, we have a great need for supplies. Please visit  http://www.second.org
for a list of needed supplies and for locations to drop off clothing.

This is the moment we can touch this city for Christ.  Let me thank you
in advance for the contributions you will make.  I know I can count on
our Second family to make a difference and give these precious people a
second chance.


It's time to Make a Difference!
Ed Young

distress, a shelter  from the storm and a shade from the heat?Isaiah 25:
