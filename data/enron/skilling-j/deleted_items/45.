Hello Jeffrey,
I came across your company information as I was conducting research on the Dallas Business Journal website. The article mentioned that Enron was moving into an office complex in Frisco, TX and could potentially employ up to 100 employees. 
I have recently been laid off as a contract/corporate recruiter with Nortel Networks and am interested in pursuing opportunities with Enron as you grow into your new Frisco location. By bringing my recruiting skills and background in-house as a contract or corporate recruiter, Enron can save thousands of dollars in potential external headhunter fees.
Attached is my resume for your review and distribution. If you have any questions or require further information, don't hesitate to contact me directly at 214 755 2860 or jen_recruiter@yahoo.com .
Jeffrey, thank you for your time and consideration - please re-direct me if there is someone else I need to speak with.
All the Best,
Jennifer Cato
