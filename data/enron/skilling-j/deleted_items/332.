The Community Relations department would like to thank employees for their tireless assistance last week in the wake of Tropical Storm Allison and let you know that there are many more opportunities to help Houstonians. 

To continue to volunteer in the community, call Jennifer Milligan ext. 35272 or go to home.enron.com/flood <http://home.enron.com/flood> for more information.

We also wanted to give you an update on all of the efforts made last week to the community and our employees.
