Please allow me to take a moment to express our my gratitude to Enron for a=
ssisting us (my wife, 2 daughters and me) in our desperate time of need.  A=
lthough many in Houston were affected by Tropical Storm Allison to a degree=
 worse than we, still we were in dire need of help.  Enron, the outstanding=
 company that it is, came through for us.

My family and I have been displaced from our home, and the sum total of our=
 worldly possessions now fit inside 1 half of a 2-car garage.  Enron has he=
lped us begin to put our lives back together, and I can think of no more el=
oquent or appropriate way to express our gratitude than to simply say, "Tha=
nk you."

The immense pride I feel being a part of the most innovative company in the=
 world has increased 10 fold.

My most sincere thanks,

Keith Clark
