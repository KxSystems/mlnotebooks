ES THE FIRST COMPLETE SERVICE MANAGEMENT SOLUTION  At a public event attend=
ed by press, analysts and customers from three continents last month, iCan =
announced the general availability of the iCan Provider Suite, the first co=
mplete service management solution to enable xSP business operations.  The =
iCan Provider Suite gives service providers, including IT departments that =
function like  internal corporate service providers (ICSPs) critical busine=
ss tools to:   Meter resource usage across Internet domains  Set up a servi=
ce catalog   Automatically provision customers   Rapidly roll out new servi=
ces   Track costs and offer flexible payment terms  Monitor and enforce ser=
vice level agreements (SLAs)   Drastically reduce operating expenses   In t=
he words of iCan CEO, Nancy Li:  "The iCan Provider Suite was built from th=
e ground up to help service providers succeed in the Internet services mark=
et. It enables xSPs and corporate IT departments to boost service levels, c=
urb expenses and strengthen their accountability to their customers."      =
"xSPs that intend to survive and create high-volume businesses must streaml=
ine and automate their service-management operations. In many ways, the sof=
tware-as-services model - if executed correctly - operates like a utility m=
odel. The iCan Provider Suite is a complete solution for these requirements=
."  ? Laurie McCabe, Vice President and Service Director for market researc=
her Summit Strategies      The iCan Provider Suite performs a series of hig=
hly-integrated operational and business support functions that, taken toget=
her, comprise a comprehensive service management solution for the full spec=
trum of service providers. The software, the first of its kind, is the culm=
ination of a year-long, 200,000 man-hour development effort. Prior to the l=
aunch, beta testing in actual production environments was conducted at cust=
omer and partner sites over the previous seven months.  iCan is currently w=
orking with customers in the U.S., Europe and Asia who represent the full s=
pectrum of xSPs. For more on these clients and what they're saying about th=
e benefits of the iCan solution, click here .  The iCan Provider Suite cons=
ists of five complementary modules:    iCan View  - allows service provider=
s and IT departments to create a service catalog, manage groups of users as=
 separate accounts, support personalization, provide simplified data presen=
tation and analysis, and reduce administrative overhead.   iCan Meter  - en=
ables service providers to collect information from all data sources across=
 domains and measure customer application, server and network activity.   i=
Can Assure  - allows service providers to define and measure service level =
agreements (SLAs) and create new service offerings without additional codin=
g.   iCan Bill  - permits service providers to move beyond flat-rate pricin=
g and price their services based on actual usage and cost of service.   iCa=
n Provision  - allows IT departments and other service providers to automat=
ically provision services for new users and accounts.  Please click here  f=

er Suite.      [IMAGE]CLIENT SPOTLIGHT: THE iCAN PROVIDER SUITE HELPS A FUL=
L-SERVICE ASP SHINE MORE BRIGHTLY  SOLAR Inc., Hong Kong's first full-servi=
ce ASP, is on the fast track. Within one year of its formation, the service=
 provider has established a strong presence in southern China and is rapidl=
y expanding into the greater China market.  Experiencing rapid growth, SOLA=
R needs to bring on new customers quickly without adding to headcount. The =
iCan Provider Suite, according to SOLAR's CEO, Hera Siu, makes this possibl=
e.   [IMAGE]  "SOLAR has saved significant administrative time and boosted =
our efficiencies by deploying the iCan Provider Suite," Siu says. "This has=
 freed-up staff to perform more revenue-generating tasks. With iCan Bill we=
 have centralized and automated our billing process. Customer communication=
s," she adds, "have improved through the notices we are posting with iCan V=
iew."  SOLAR was able to save significant administrative time on data colle=
ction and analysis by utilizing the iCan suite. The ASP was also able to mo=
nitor its data center's Internet connection. The streamlined operating envi=
ronment freed the SOLAR staff to undertake cost-reducing and revenue-genera=
ting tasks, such as improving capacity management and performing data back-=
up services.  With the suite's iCan Bill component, SOLAR was also able to =
centralize and automate its billing process, further reducing the administr=
ative work involved in consolidating and verifying invoices.  Customer comm=
unications costs were pared as well, by posting service notices through the=
 iCan View component in lieu of mail or e-mail.  To learn more about SOLAR =

AGE]iCAN ENTERS THE JAPANESE MARKET WITH KCCS  Kyocera Communication System=
s (KCCS), a leading provider of information communication services, has bec=
ome iCan's first Japanese customer.  In an announcement made last week at C=
A World, in Orlando, Fla., KCCS said it had chosen the iCan Provider Suite =
as the service management solution for its new, state-of-the-art wireless d=
ata centers.  [IMAGE]   The KCCS data centers will provide a ready-for-mark=
et  wireless platform that will deliver such services as wireless data deli=
very, email and messaging, electronic account settlement, remote printing s=
ervices and data backup. To manage these services, KCCS will deploy the iCa=
n Provider Suite to meter, provision, bill and maintain service levels for =
the full spectrum of its data center offerings.  "Our D@TA Center will offe=
r the most complete range of high-performance mobile services ... It was on=
ly fitting then, when it came time to select a service management platform,=
 that KCCS chose the iCan solution, which is the most advanced and sophisti=
cated set of business tools for service providers available today." ? Mr. H=
iroshi Kitamura managing director, KCCS  Click here  for detailed informati=
on on this customer partnership.      [IMAGE]iCAN HIGHLIGHTS FROM CA WORLD =
- SERVICING THE ENTERPRISE   [IMAGE]  The 'software-as-service' model is be=
ing adopted by corporate IT, and the iCan Provider Suite enables IT departm=
ents to function as internal corporate service providers (ICSPs). That mess=
age was well received last week at CA World in Orlando, Fla., where iCan re=
presentatives met with several hundred CIOs and senior IT managers and demo=
nstrated the advantages of the iCan Provider Suite firsthand. While there w=
ere many questions, especially concerning how best to service customers in =
various industries, there was also a strong consensus on two key points: 1)=
 The software-as-a-service model makes sense, because it helps IT more accu=
rately gauge and reduce costs, manage service levels and justify budgets; a=
nd 2) whether it's for internal users or external customers, th! e ! iCan P=
rovider Suite  addresses the critical functions needed to successfully prov=
ide IT services.  For more on servicing the enterprise, click here . For iC=
