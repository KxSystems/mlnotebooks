Jeff:

I have a major problem with Ben Glisan being deleted, especially without a chance to comment.  I believe he is as critical to the organization as all of the "tier two" members (and has had a larger p/l contribution).  If you disagree, I need to know so I can appropriately set his expectations.  I look at this list and I cannot discern the standard for inclusion.  This standard must be clear and will be closely watched by all employees.

Andy
