MEMO: 
TO: World Technology Network Nominees 
FROM: Neil Davison, Assistant to the Chairman (James P. Clark) & Membership 
Manager, The World Technology Network (WTN). 
RE: Update about the World Technology Summit & Awards, London, 1 &2 July 
held in association with Nasdaq, GlaxoSmithkline, Business Week, CNBC, & 
Nature 
________________________________________________________ 
With less than two weeks until the historic gathering of innovators known as 
the World Technology Summit (July 1st & 2nd), we wanted to make contact with 
all World Technology Award Nominees to let those who have not yet registered know that there is still time to do so and to update them on what is happening.  (NOTE: If you have already registered please disregard this e-mail.  You will have received a separate registered delegate e-mail). 
Registration can be completed online at: http://www.wtn.net/summit2001  
The Update: 
An absolutely extraordinary group of people will be participating in the 
Summit. Many of them are your fellow World Technology Network (WTN) members (primarily previous World Technology Award Nominators or Finalists/Winners spread out across the 23 various categories of the membership).  A second large group is made up of 2001 Award Nominators and Nominees. Another 
contingent is composed of individuals who have applied to attend through 
outreach efforts by various partner organisations (we have selected a few 
dozen from amongst hundreds of applicants).  And, finally, others are 
business leaders specially invited in particular by two of our partners, Nasdaq and 
Business Week. The potential for serendipity is enormous. 
Speakers include, among many others, Sir Richard Sykes (Chairman, 
GlaxoSmithkline): Paul Hogg (Editor, "Materials Technology" magazine); Andrew 
Bermingham (Managing Director, Montreux Energy Roundtables); Peter J. Denning 
(Co-Editor, "Beyond Calculation: The Next 50 Years of Computing"); David 
Isenberg (leading telecommunications provocateur); and Dr. Aram Mika (Vice 
President, Lockheed Martin Advanced Technologies Center). Moderators for the 
Summit include Nigel Roberts, CNBC television anchor; Paul Maraviglia, 
Managing Director Europe, Business Week; Reinhart Helmke, Executive Director, 
United Nations Office of Project Services (UNOPS); and Dr. Philip Campbell, 
Editor, Nature. 
It is also worth mentioning that McKinsey & Co.'s, Richard N. Foster, 
co-author of one of the most talked-about and catalytic business books around 
these days, "CREATIVE DESTRUCTION", will also be delivering a keynote address on Monday morning, 2 July. 
NOTE: CNBC is particularly interested in interviewing leaders of public (or 
soon-to-be-public) companies while at the Summit, so if you are open to that 
possibility, please let us know as soon as possible. 
Remember that the Summit agenda can be accessed through the Summit web site http://www.wtn.net/Summit2001  as well as the online registration form. 
If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate for a moment 
to get in touch.
