Ken/Jeff -- You are scheduled to each do a one-hour in-person interview today with Rick Kash, author of a book, "The New Law of Supply and Demand."  Norm Blake requested your participation in this project.  The book has been purchased by Doubleday and will be published next summer.   The premise of the book is that the world economy has moved from supply-driven to demand-driven, and successful companies are those that understand how demand drives supply.  The book also includes case studies of EMC and McDonald's.   We will have the opportunity to review the manuscript before it goes to press.

The interview schedule is:
	1:30 to 2:30 p.m. - Jeff
	2:30 to 3:30 p.m. - Ken

I will bring Rick to your office at these times and will sit in on the interview to coordinate any follow-up requests.

Thank you.
Karen
