3 July 2001 
  
TO:   All Nominees for the 2001 World Technology Award for Commerce. 
On Monday evening, 2 July, at a gala ceremony held here in London at the National Museum of Science & Industry, we announced the Finalists and Winners of the 2001 World Technology Awards.  The Awards ceremony was held at the close of the World Technology Summit, which brought together many of this year's Award nominees from around the world, along with previous Winners, Finalists, and Nominators (the WTN membership).  The Winner and other Finalists are automatically inducted as Members of the WorldTechnology Network.  All other other nominees for the Awards now become Associates of the World Technology Network.  (NOTE: We will be contacting separately those Finalists who were unable to attend the Summit and Awards ceremony). On behalf of the WTN membership, and our global partners -- Nasdaq, GlaxoSmithkline, Enron, Business Week, CNBC, and Nature,  we are very pleased to announce the Winners and Finalists for the 2001 World Technology Award for Commerce: 
2001 World Technology Award for Commerce 
Winner: 
Mr. Linus Torvalds, Programmer, Transmeta Corp., USA. 
Finalists: 
Mr. Jeffrey Bezos, Founder, Amazon , USA.

The World Technology Awards process is designed to identify and honour the most innovative people in the technology world.  The Nomination for all of the various World Technology Awards involved well over 100 expert Nominators from across the globe, who suggested those individuals doing the work of the greatest likely long-term significance in their respective fields. Then, over the past few months, the WTN membership reviewed the nominations and selected their top five within their own Award category.  To even be nominated for the Award meant that one of the Nominators felt a Nominee was amongst the top few in the world and for that all nominees deserve huge congratulations. 
The Nominators for the 2001 World Technology Award for Commerce were: 
Prof. Chong-ji Choi Director, MBA Programme, Cambridge University, UK. 
Prof. Soumitra Dutta, Director, ELab@INSEAD, INSEAD, France. 
Dr. Gerhard Fasol, President, Eurotechnology,  Japan. 
Mr. David Ticoll, Managing Partner & CEO, Digital4Sight, USA.

Mr. John Griffith

As some nominees were not able to attend the World Technology Summit (1 and 2 July), held at Imperial College of Science, Technology, and Medicine, we made sure that we videotaped each of the Summit plenary sessions of the as well as the Awards ceremony for "webcast."  It should take at least a few weeks to 
get that presentation ready, but we will notify you as soon as it is so that you can get a taste for the extraordinary gathering which occured here in London over the past few days. 
For a full list of Winners and Finalists for the 2001 World Technology Awards in all 23 categories, and for more information about the World Technology Network, please visit the WTN web site at:  http://www.wtn.net .
