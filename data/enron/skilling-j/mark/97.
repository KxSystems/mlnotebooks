Jeff,

Wanted to drop a quick note to follow up on our conversation on Saturday. 

I am definitely interested in what the plan sounds like as modified. If you 
and I can find the right combination of tasks, it should work well; the 
matters you mentioned would all seem to fit into a split schedule. 

My schedule can be as flexible as needed, with the only restriction (a big 
one, I must admit) being that I would want to spend as much time in Istanbul 
as possible, both for Sukran and me. 

As we discussed, if you and I think there is a niche that would make sense 
for me, I could be in Houston for up to six months a year. Perhaps it would 
be helpful if we initially assumed that my schedule would include one month 
in Houston then one month in Istanbul, followed by two longer two-month 
periods in Houston and Istanbul.?This?schedule could be fragmented or even 
consolidated further, and of course there would have to a fair amount of 
playing it by ear. One thing I would be trying to do as things played out -- 
provided of course that none of my projects with you was put at risk -- would 
be to shave off a week here, a day or two there, so as to maximize my time in 
Istanbul.? I would do what was necessary to have myself well-wired into the 
States, and should be able to handle quite a few things effectively even from 
here. ??

As I mentioned, I have a lot going on here these next four or five months 
getting things set up with Sukran, but I could come to Houston for a month 
here, a month there, perhaps for the first time in approximately a month. 
After that, full-steam ahead. 

You might be wondering about my present work.?I would try to hold onto the 
newsletter, as that would continue to provide a great vehicle for my learning 
and writing about this place. Otherwise, my work here is not something we 
should worry to much about as we consider the above further. 

Yours with love,

Mark 

P.S.? Enjoy the festivities in Washington and say hey to Tom.
