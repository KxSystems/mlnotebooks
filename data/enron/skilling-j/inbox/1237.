	Dear Valued  Client,		
	The recent tragic events have left us all with  many questions. I wanted to take a moment to share with you my thoughts  on the events on Tuesday and their impact on the future. Through this all,  we will keep the victims and the families affected by this tragedy in our  prayers. 	[IMAGE]	
	As the situation around the world unfolds, we  will continue to keep you apprised of the actions we are taking to make  sure that your interest as our valued client remains uppermost in our minds.  Schwab.com  will be updated regularly as news and information changes. 	 A  video from Charles R. Schwab  Frequently  Asked Questions  Personal  letter from Charles Schwab, founder 	
			
		 We stand ready to serve you and conduct business  as normal, providing the market wisdom and support you need most. We are  working closely with the stock markets, federal government, regulators and  other members of the financial services community to ensure America?s financial  markets return to normal. 	
			
		 I  continue to believe a long-term approach is the wisest course of action,  although I do recognize that some short-term volatility will likely  occur when markets reopen. Please consider this in placing orders  prior to market reopen. My  advice to you is the same investment advice I have offered clients  for over 40 years: invest for the long term and maintain a diversified  portfolio--and stay calm during the rough times.  	
		We know that each individual's  situation is unique. I encourage you to explore our web site, visit a Schwab  office, or call us at 1-800-435-4000 with any questions. We stand ready  to assist you with all of your financial services needs during these challenging  times.  	
			
	Thank You,  [IMAGE]
