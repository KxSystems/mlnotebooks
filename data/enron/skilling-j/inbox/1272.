Hey guys,

As you know today is the home opener of SMU's 2001 season and we play rival
TCU.  Beta's on campus will be tailgating on The Boulevard.  If any of you
saw us last year, we will be farther north than that, closer to the turn at
the top.

Sorry for the vague description, hopefully next week we'll have a map up
(along with the rest of the alumni site) on http://www.smu.edu/~beta

Come find us and have a burger and a beer if you're planning on going to the
game.

Andrew Carty
Alumni Chair

At Homecoming 2000, the BETA TENT had the biggest crowd by far.  Stay connected and consider a future homecoming BETA reunion.  It's incredible...forget the 20 years in between...everyone just seems to pick it up right where they left off years ago.
