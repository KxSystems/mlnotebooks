Jeff,
 
On Saturday, September 29th, I am being honored with the National Multiple Sclerosis  Society's Hope  Award during their  annual Maxine Mesinger Dinner of  Champions event.  This award is beinggiven to me due to the hard work and  dedication that BMC Software  employees have shown this great cause through the years.  I understand that you were the recipient of this award last year, so you know  that the key to a successful event is the selection of the dinner  committee, which is then used to  build the invitation list and to build excitement for attending the event from  local leaders.  Of course, the  key to successfully developing the dinner committee is the selection of the  Chairman of the committee.
 
I would be honored  if you would agree to serve as the Chairman of the dinner committee.  You were  the first name that came to mind and the best person I could hope for to assure  a successful event. I am told that your personal time commitment would be  very minimal.  It would require your attendance at the dinner event on  September 29th in downtown Houston.  The dinner is typically from 7:00pm until 10:00pm,but the actual ceremony is less  than 30 minutes long with some brief comments by you and then an acceptance  speech given by yours truly.  The primary obligation beyond attending the  event would be to allow us to use your name and signature in sending out the  invitations to the dinner committee members.  I would provide you with a  recommended invitation list. The MS team would make sure that  your time and image would be well respected.
 
Thank you Jeff,
 
Bob
