Global Energy Markets 
Global Energy Markets is an information service that gives you access to updated information and analysis whenever you need it.

Global Energy Markets provides many different news feeds and data sources in one service.  In addition, Global Energy Markets provides useful online databases for finding articles, projects and companies.

Each service is available by global region.  Services include the Americas, Asia-Pacific, Europe/CIS and the Middle East.  Each service includes four key modules.

The first core module is the energy news.  The news comes from Reuters, Dow Jones, Energy24x, BBC, AP, AFP, and others.  This is an all-in-one regional news service.  The other three modules are useful databases for finding news articles, project information and companies.  The second module is the Global Energy Projects Database.  The third module is the Global Energy News Archive.  The fourth is the Energy Companies Directory.
