RENEWABLE ENERGY FACT SHEETS

UNEPs Energy Programme addresses the environmental consequences of energy
production and use, such as global climate change and local air pollution.
It assists decision-makers in government and the private sector to make
better, more informed energy choices which fully integrate environmental and
social costs.

One of the areas UNEP Energy (www.uneptie.org) is concerned with is
renewable energy issues, and has published a series of Renewable Energy
Technology fact sheets on various types of renewable energies.
