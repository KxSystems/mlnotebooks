[IMAGE]=09 [IMAGE]     Dear Jeffrey Skilling,   Now that fall is finally he=
re, it is time to showcase  the season?s brilliant color. Decorators in the=
 know accentuate  this changing season with the high-energy hues of gold, b=
urgundy,  orange and yellow. Calyx & Corolla has taken their cue. We  offer=
 a divine medley of colorful bouquets, preserved designs  and even bulb kit=
s paying tribute to fall.   Our Williamsburg  Bouquet  (shown right) is a s=
tunning assortment of terra cotta  colored roses, golden Peruvian lilies, r=
usset hypericum berries  and unusual velvety orange coxcomb. It truly recre=
ates the look  of the pedigreed blooms found in the historical manor homes =
of  Virginia. The exceptional crackle-finish footed urn in which it  is dis=
played is adapted from those in the European market circa  1800.    Our swe=
et Rose  Spice Wreath  brings a concentration of fall color to a small  are=
a while our Golden  Harvest Roses  proclaim the season in a riotous display=
. Combining  ruffled yellow roses with flaming orange roses it's a wonderfu=
l  choice for any occasion   We're pleased to introduce our new Ranunculus =
 Bulb Kit . This sophisticated flower is well known for its  dense, round h=
eads of distinctive crepe paper-like petals and  has been noted by many tre=
nd watchers for its growing popularity.  Our kit is a unique take on these =
blooms and makes a perfect gift,  especially for those with children.   We =
invite you to visit our Sale page for limited-time offers  & our Birthdays =
  page for darling gift-giving ideas.    Calyx  & Corolla   =09[IMAGE]=09
