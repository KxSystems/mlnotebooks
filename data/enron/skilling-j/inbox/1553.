I received a message from your brother Mark Shillings. He mentioned that he would be working with you in managing some of your personal accounts and wanted to communicate with me about such. 
Do I have your authority to discuss your banking business and accounts with him ? Also is there anything in particular you and he are looking to do that we may be able to help with ?
