[IMAGE] =09 [IMAGE]     Dear Jeffrey Skilling,    Calyx and Corolla's new f=
all selection of floral, plant and preserved arrangements is quite possibly=
 the most excitingly beautiful collection in the world.  What we love most =
is each arrangement quietly conveys heartfelt thoughts and emotions in an e=
xquisite manner allowing us to truly treasure the times we have with our de=
ar family and friends.  A true expression of beauty and purity can  be foun=
d in our Golden Lily Plant  (shown right). Its coloring makes this lily  - =
a new  hybrid developed just last year - a natural for the fall season.  Ou=
r Vineyard  Bouquet  reflects the relaxed, unpretentious hospitality of  co=
untryside living. Sunflowers, viking pompom mums, and lacy solidago  are ca=
sually presented in a big, rustic brass urn with an antiqued  rust finish. =
  Our exclusive Pumpkin  Patch Basket  symbolizes nature's harvest and the =
inspiration  of a new season unfolding.   We're enchanted with the wonderfu=
lly vibrant bouquets our travels  have discovered, including  our infamous =
Blue  Ribbon Gerbera Daisies  and the bold yet beautiful Jungle  Mum Bouque=
t .  Each illuminates distinction and pays tribute to a special occasion.  =
Please view our Sale   and Specials   pages for limited-time offers.  Calyx=
