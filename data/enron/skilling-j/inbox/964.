Dear Bros,
    I hate forwards on emails as much as the next guy, and perhaps it's the
last several beers I've just shared with brothers Grumbles, Elvis and the
Mule that causes me to forward this one.  Then again, maybe it's because I
couldn't have written it better myself.  For what it's worth.

Drow

A friend of mine sent this to me.  It is well worth your time to read... and
pray.
 >
 >
 > President  Bush
 >
 > This was the same man who came within a hair's breadth of losing an
 > election
 > in November, who withstood the political chicanery of the Florida
 > Democratic
 > machine to fix the vote count.
 > This was the same man who admitted to having a drinking problem in
 > younger years, and whose happy-go-lucky lifestyle led him to mediocre
 > grades in college and an ill-fated oil venture.
 > This was the same man who mangled syntax even more than his father,  and
 > whose speaking missteps became known as "Bushisms."
 > And on Friday, this was the man who bore the weight of the world and
 > the responsibilities of a generation with dignity, class, confidence,
 > appropriate solemnity, and even much-needed wit.
 >
 > One thing struck me during the campaign, that difficult, roller-coaster
 > campaign that now seems years ago. It was that George W. Bush never
 > seemed to get ruffled. Whether the theft of a campaign debate video or
 > the sudden (some would say, vicious) release of a DUI arrest two
 > decades  ago at a key moment, "W" did not lose his cool. At times, his
staff
 > seemed overconfident, as did many of us. A 350-electoral-vote win,
 > they  quietly implied  . . . and we optimistically believed.
 >
 > Then they counted the votes, miscounted others, and re-counted still
others.
 > At the end, he was still there. Whereas Al Gore almost frantically huffed
 > and puffed,
 > trying to gin up something out of nothing, Bush quietly but confidently
 > waited at his ranch.  He didn't do nothing: that is the mistake people
have
 > constantly made with this man, confusing lack of  bluster for absence of
 > action.
 > No, his team of attorneys and the iron-willed James Baker were carrying
 > out his orders, but W stayed in the background, confident and faithful.
 >
 > You see, it is this faith business that confounded everyone. We have had
 > such actors and liars in public office that we have looked skeptically
 > whenever anyone used the term faith.  But this was the same man who
 > was the first politician ever in recent memory to name Jesus Christ as
 > the Lord of his life on public TV. Not an oblique reference to being
 > "born-again" or having a "life change." He said the un-PC-like phrase,
 > "Jesus Christ," to which his handlers and advisors, no doubt, off  stage,
 > were also saying, "Jesus Christ" in a much different tone.
 >
 > God has a way of honoring those who honor Him. David learned that while
 > he was on the run from Saul's armies. Job learned that after his time of
 > horrible tribulation. The Messiah said so Himself,  many times.
 > So this was the man who actually put faith into practice. He actually
 > loves those who hate him. It is a staggering concept, so foreign in
 > daily occurrence that few thought it anything but grandstanding. Even one
 > of W's biggest supporters chided the President for adhering to his
 > "new tone." Yet there he was, again and again, thanking the Democrats.
 > Appointing his enemies to high places in his government. Inviting his
 > former foes and their wives to private movie screenings, and (I know,
 > this is hard to stomach) even treating them with dignity.
 >
 > See, this was the man who learned early on how  faith worked: by praying
 > for his enemies, you "heap burning coals upon their heads."
 > This was the man who named the absolute top people in national
 > security and defense, then caught barbs from the politically righteous
that
 > this one didn't have the right views on abortion or that one didn't have
 > the right position on guns.
 >
 > And on September 11, at mid-morning, this was the man thrust into a
 > position only known by Roosevelt, Churchill, Lincoln, and Washington.
 > The weight of the world was on his shoulders, and the responsibility of
 > a generation was on his soul.  So this same man---the one that the
 > media repeatedly attempted to tarnish with charges of "illegitimacy," and
 > the one whose political opponents desperately sought to stonewall until
 > mid-term elections---walked to his seat at the front of the National
 > Cathedral
 > just three days after the two most impressive symbols of American
capitalism
 > and prosperity virtually evaporated, along with, perhaps, thousands of
 > Americans. As he sat down next to his wife, immediately I knew that even
if
 > his
 > faith ever faltered, hers didn't. I have never seen a more peaceful face
 > than Laura Bush, whose eyes seemed as though they were already gazing
 > at the final outcome . . . not just of this conflict, but of her reward
in
 > Heaven itself. In this marriage, you indeed got two for the price of one.
 >
 > Then came the defining moment of our generation. Some people fondly
 > recall their Woodstock days. Others mark with grim sadness November 22,
 > 1963, as the day America lost her innocence. But I firmly believe when
 > the history of this time is written, it will be acknowledged by friend
 > and foe alike that President George W. Bush came of age in that
 > cathedral and lifted a nation off its knees.  It wasn't so much his
 > words, though read a decade later, they will indeed be as stirring as
 > any. This conflict would end, he noted, ". . . at a time of our
 > choosing."  It certainly wasn't his emotion. What had to have been one
 > of the most stunning exhibitions of self-control in presidential history,
 > W was able to deliver his remarks without losing either his resolve or
his
 > focus, or, more important, his confidence. It was as if God's hand, which
 > had guided him through that sliver-thin election, now rested fully on
him.
 > His quiet confidence let our enemies know . . . and believe me, they
 > know. . . that they made a grave miscalculation.
 >
 > Now, this same man who practiced his faith through a tough election,
 > who steeled his convictions even more in a drawn-out Florida battle,
 > and who never once gave in to the temptation to get in the gutter with
his
 > foes
 > (well, ok, maybe the "Clymer" comment is an exception), this same man now
 > lifted
 > the weight of the world and the responsibility of a generation and put
 > it on his modest shoulders as though it were another unpleasant duty.
 >
 > As he walked back to his seat, the camera angle was appropriate. He was
 > virtually alone in the scene, alone in that massive place of God, just
 > him and the Lord. But that's the way it's always been in his life
 > recently.  In that brief time it took him to return to his seat, I
 > believe he heard words to the effect of, "You can do this, George.
 > I am with you always. And you can do this well, because I am going before
 > you. And don't worry about the weight. I've got it." And I saw in his
 > eyes a quiet acknowledgement. "I know. Thank you,  Lord."
 >
 > Back at his seat, when W sat down,  George H. W. Bush reached over
 > and took his son's hand. The elder Bush always struck me as a religious
 > man, but not someone who shared his life on a daily basis with the Lord.
 > George H. W. treats the Father like a respected uncle, visiting Him
 > on appropriate holidays and knowing the relationship is real, but not
 > constant.
 >
 > Anyway, I believe that in that fatherly squeeze George H. W. said, "I
 > wish I could do this for you, son, but I can't. You have to do this on
your
 > own."
 > W squeezed back and gave him that look of peace that Laura had kept
 > throughout. It said, "I don't have to do it alone, dad. I've got help."

At Homecoming 2000, the BETA TENT had the biggest crowd by far.  Stay connected and consider a future homecoming BETA reunion.  It's incredible...forget the 20 years in between...everyone just seems to pick it up right where they left off years ago.
