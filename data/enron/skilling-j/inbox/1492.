Jeff,

Mona Yousry and I are both sending you seperate messages regarding Mr. Larr=
y Robinson.  I have known Larry for 30 years.  I spent 3 years in Tanzania =
with Larry and his father when I was 16 years old.  My father was the only =
M.D. at an 80 bed hospital 40 miles north of Kigoma, Tanzania.
=20
Larry is assisting the Maasai tribes in Tanzania by installing solar powere=
d water pumps.  Larry is looking for creative ways to fund the solar projec=
ts, which are obviously energy related.  Larry has access to various tribal=
 art works that could be imported back to the states as well as offering un=
ique safaris into areas of East Africa that are not on the map so to speak.=
  The trading of art or safaris for solar resources seems to some how fit a=
 model that you are an expert in.  Namely trading. =20
Based on what I have read about you, your interest in dangerous and thrilli=
ng adventures combined with your access to financial or energy related solu=
tions and knowing Larry, a truly one of a kind human being, would you be wi=
lling to start a dialog with him? =20
I asked Larry to write something about himself and life in Africa.  I am at=
taching it as is, for your review. =20

Best Regards,
Jonathan

My father was born in Zimbabwe, Africa. My parents and grandparents were Mi=
ssionaries. My grandparents went to Africa from California in 1912 and are =
both buried in Africa. I was raised in very remote areas of the Belgian Con=
go and from an early age spent lots of time in the African Bush. This was a=
 time to learn many of the secrets necessary to survive the African bush an=
d love it. I had the opportunity to study and learn animal behavior in ways=
 that most experts only dream about. Some of my greatest memories are from =
times I would take a pocket full of salt with my rifle and go into the bush=
 for 10 days to 2 weeks at a time, sometimes totally alone. It was also a t=
ime to learn about the African people and their languages and cultures. As =
time passed and Independence swept the Continent, I saw Zaire, the great la=
nd where I was born, turn into a blood bath. I learned more about the most =
savage creature of! all. As I saw men slaughter men, women, and children, I=
 understood better how organized and balanced nature really is. I am a U.S.=
 Citizen and Resident in Tanzania, East Africa. I am tri-lingual and unders=
tand three other African languages. I have an FAA Commercial Pilots license=
. Educated in Cape Town, South Africa, Singapore, Beirut, Lebanon, Michigan=
, and California. Have two B.S. degrees. One in Agriculture and one in Indu=
strial Education. Have traveled around the world many times. My longest ove=
rland trip was from Germany to Cape Town driving my own Toyota Land Cruiser=
. This was a 10 month journey of over 30,000 miles. Crossing the Sahara Des=
ert and the Kalahari Desert before a GPS was available was indeed a great a=
dventure. From 1985 to 1992 I owned and operated my own Import Export Compa=
ny in Central Africa called "Malaika Zaire".  Presently I am Managing Direc=
tor and Chairman of the Board of "Solar Universal Network" - a Californian =
Non-profit Organization, 501! (c)3. Solar Universal Network is also establi=
shed in Tanzania as an International NGO since 1995. S.U.N.'s primary focus=
 is to establish safe, permanent, water supplies for communities in Tanzani=
a using alternative energy. An example of our work is at Sukenya, Northern =
Tanzania where we are pumping approximately 12,000 gallons of water per day=
 from 250 feet deep for the Maasai Community using only Solar Energy. This =
system has been operating for a year now with outstanding success. When nec=
essary, we also use UV Water Purification Units powered by Solar Energy to =
purify any contamination which may exist in water supplies.  One of the are=
as we are now working in is located in Northern Tanzania just South of the =
Kenya boarder and just East of the Serengeti National Park. This is conside=
red Maasai Land and is fascinating country. Each year hundreds of thousands=
 Wilderbeasts migrate south through this area to give birth to their young =
in the Southern plains of the Serengeti! . The great migration is considere=
d one of natures last unmatched marvels on earth. This is the time when the=
 predators like lions, leopards, cheetah, and hyena are roaming the area. T=
here are also heards of Cape Buffalo, Elephant, and many types of antelope =
and zebra. Because of the Community Development that S.U.N. has done in thi=
s area, we have an exceptional opportunity to hike, camp, and hunt with the=
 Maasai in this location. I have personally been within 10 yards of a lion =
and his kill while on foot with a Maasai warrior and only a spear in hand. =
 Tanzania is also the land of Mt. Kilimanjaro, Serengeti National Park, Ngo=
rongoro Crater, Lake Victoria, and Zanzibar Island.
