    Thursday, November 01, 2001 Issue 40   EDITORIAL  In this edition...  .=
..we take a closer look at the state of play in the green energy market, an=
d also at technologies, not planned or anticipated, but with us right now t=
hat can bring alternative energy strategies to fruition.   There are just a=
 few remaining places on the delegate register for the Eyeforenergy Green C=
onvention in Brussels next week, so if you are intending to go and haven't =
yet registered - please do so today!   In 'Going Green: The Bottom Line', t=
he first of our two articles on green energy, Abyd Karmali, VP of ICF Consu=
lting, points to the increasing importance of emissions trading as a key en=
vironmental issue.  We also examine the relative market share currently enj=
oyed (or lamented?) by the main renewable energy initiatives: wind, solar, =
biomass and fuel cells.   Speakers are lining up rapidly for our three co-l=
ocated events in Amsterdam, 19-21 February 2002: Energy Trading Online, Wea=
ther Trading and Emissions Trading.  Recently confirmed include Enron, LIFF=
E, TXU and NatSource.  The programmes for all three are likely to be filled=
 over the next couple of weeks, so if you are interested in speaking please=
 contact Allison Robertshaw (arobertshaw@eyeforenergy.com ) for Energy and =
Weather Trading and Meabh Quoirin (mquoirin@eyeforenergy.com ) for Emission=
s Trading as soon as possible.   I hope you enjoy this edition of the Eyefo=
renergy Briefing: your feedback, as always, is welcome and can be directed =
to bruno@eyeforenergy.com .    --Sarah Robinson, Marketing & PR Director   =
 FOCUS   Technology Driving Green Energy   Recent events have served to hig=
hlight the need to reduce our dependence on Middle Eastern oil reserves and=
 strengthen our resolve to bring alternative forms of energy into mainstrea=
m use. Most of the energy used today comes from fossil fuel, resulting in g=
reen house gas (GHG) emissions being released into the atmosphere at ever i=
ncreasing rates.  Indeed, the environment is as much a player in developing=
 the coming hydrogen economy as reducing our dependence on foreign oil rese=
rves. Carbon and sulphur dioxides are having a decided impact on our enviro=
nment, contributing to climate change and acid rain. As any school boy can =
attest, energy... Click here for Full Story      INSIGHT   Going Green: The=
 Bottom Line   Deregulation of the European gas and electric markets is a b=
lessing to some and a stone around the neck of others. With most of the Eur=
opean Union, particularly France, Italy, Greece and Portugal, dominated by =
tired old state monopolies, the opening of markets to competition is moving=
 technology to the front burner as power companies jockey for position in t=
he race to keep pace with new opportunities.  Green power initiatives move =
front and center, as concerns over the impact climate change will have on r=
ate structures when most EU markets become fully deregulated by 2005. Renew=
able, sustainable and alternative energy sources, once seen as marginal and=
 advocated by tree huggers and back to nature... Click here for Full Story =

  October 30, 2001---A recently released government backed report reached t=

The Carbon Trust, charged by the prime minister to persuade business to red=

the targets can be met if power is generated through other means such as hy=
drogen, wind and waves.   Ian McAllister, who chairs the trust... Click her=
