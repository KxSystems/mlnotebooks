Jeff,
I wonder if you received my earlier e-mail? The company I mentioned now has
a $1 million project with a US top three LTL client, based on its somewhat
innovative approach to supply chain management.
Is there an exec in Enron who might be interested in talking to the CEO?
Regards, Graham Sharman
