Dear Mr. Skilling

Your executive assistant suggested that I email you with my request.  I am
a partner of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP located in Calgary, Alberta.  On a
recent flight on United Airlines, I read with great interest, the article
in United's in-flight magazine about what you did at Enron with regard to
convergence.  To say the least, I was impressed.  Many of our clients in
the Calgary, particularly in the Energy Industry, are dealing with the
concept of convergence.

The purpose of this email is to ask if you would be a guest speaker at one
of our Executive Breakfasts.  PwC Calgary holds three to four Executive
Breakfasts each year which usually has about 100 ? 150 CEO's, CFO's
attending.  We hold these sessions at the Palliser Hotel and they do a
great job in having an upscale event.

I sincerely believe your "Enron story" will interest many of our energy
clients and non-clients.  I would be pleased to discuss this further at
your convenience.  You have my email address or I can be reached at my
Calgary office (403) 509-7530 or residence (403) 241-2930.

Best regards,


Dennis J. Hoffman
