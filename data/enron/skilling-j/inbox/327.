Jeff,

Sukran's dad asked me to translate the following to you and the family,

"Dear Jeff,

I was honored by your coming to our family.  We loved you alot.  To leave
you was very difficlut.  We miss you all and with wishes to be united in the
shortest time, and with my love and the deepest respect I send my greetings.

Durmus Karakaya and family

P.S. And to Rebecca, we send our deepest respect and wishes."

I translated this literally, and actually in Turkish Mr. Karakay's words are
much more beautiful.

Look forward to talking with you on Tuesday.

With love,

Mark and Sukran
