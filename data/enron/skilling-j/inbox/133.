Dear Investor:

Houston Technology Center is pleased to be a supporter of the Texas Venture
Capital Conference.  Scheduled for May 16th, in Austin, Texas at the Four
Seasons Hotel, the Texas Venture Capital Conference is hosted by The Capital
Network (TCN) in partnership with AeA (American Electronics Association).
Complete information and registration is available on TCN's website at

The program will showcase 25 fast-growing ventures selected by a panel of
investors, including Austin Ventures, TL Ventures, Sevin Rosen, Access
Venture Partners, Triton Ventures, First Capital Group and others.  These
funds have identified a group of attractive ventures in Internet and network
infrastructure, telecommunications and enterprise applications, seeking A, B

In addition to reviewing a group of qualified and exciting investment
opportunities, the Texas Venture Capital Conference provides you the
opportunity to network with leading venture capitalists, corporate
investors, sophisticated angel investors, and investment bankers from around
the country.  You'll also hear from leading industry analysts including
Stephen H. Sigmond - recognized as one of the top tech research analysts on
Wall Street and Dr. Anitesh Barua - renown for his research in the Internet
Economy and E-business Value Assessment.  This year we're also pleased to
invite you to a special kick-off reception at the home of Texas Governor,
Rick Perry, on May 15th at 6:00 pm.  We will also hold the Investors' Golf
Invitational on May 17th at Barton Creek Country Club.  These events are
designed to maximize your networking opportunities, providing you with both
deal flow and business contacts.

We look forward to seeing you there.
