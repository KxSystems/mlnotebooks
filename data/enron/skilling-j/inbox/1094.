Stephanie,

Could you send out this add to members of the cycling club?  I've got an extra bike rack from a friend who went overseas so I'd like to sell it.

Thanks,
Mike Cleveland

For Sale - Thule 4-bike "Hitching Post " bike rack for use with 2" receiver hitch.  Only used a few times before owner went overseas.  $160 new, will sell for $75.
