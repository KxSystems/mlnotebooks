    Thursday, October 04, 2001 Issue 38   EDITORIAL  A Focus on the latest =
developments in Europe Today's briefing takes a look at what's going on in =
the European energy marketplace.  It's been an interesting year...deregulat=
ion, new regulation on renewables, the IPE bought out by the ICE, American =
energy companies staking their claims and European companies crossing the p=
ond.  With all the articles written about California's failed experiment wi=
th deregulation, little attention has been focused on how the European coun=
tries have faired in their move to more deregulated markets.  And just like=
 in the US, the changes in the European market offer a number of opportunit=
ies for companies providing new developments in billing and CRM software, t=
rading solutions, and communications.  Two articles below take a look at th=
e state of play in Europe. This also gives us the opportunity to announce o=
ur new European conferences.  We'll be bringing the successful Energy Excha=
nges Online event over to Europe, as well as co-locating it with 2 other ev=
ents:  Weather Trading 2002  and Emissions Trading 2002 , to provide delega=
tes with the most comprehensive trading event in Europe.  To find out more =

shaw, Editor   Q&A   European Utility Sector: Survival of the Fittest Throu=
gh Mergers & Acquisition   Chaos theory attempts to explain the fact that c=
omplex and unpredictable results can and often will occur in systems that a=
re sensitive to their initial conditions. Such is the case of today's utili=
ties market as companies face increased demands for profits from shareholde=
rs while consumers are keenly aware of choices brought on by deregulation a=
nd increased competition.  It is a harsh environment for an industry accust=
omed to operating in an inflexible, monopolistic manner. The information ag=
e has spawned a more knowledgeable, more demanding consumer, forcing modern=
 utilities to adapt quickly to change, and forge new alliances, in some cas=
es with old enemies, through... Click here for Full Story    INSIGHT   EU D=
eregulation: Out of Chaos Comes Order   The European Union is moving quickl=
y toward deregulating and privatizing electrical utilities. The move will a=
llow power companies to sell electricity throughout the Union and will give=
 consumers more choice about where they get their power and how much they p=
ay for it.  Regulation, Deregulation and Reregulation At its core there is =
really no such thing as deregulation. There is simply the re-regulation of =
old economies and sectors. That is the state of affairs as Europe continues=
 its somewhat rocky march to energy deregulation. Restructuring, privatizat=
ion... Click here for Full Story    ADVERTISEMENT  [IMAGE] Eyeforenergy Gre=
