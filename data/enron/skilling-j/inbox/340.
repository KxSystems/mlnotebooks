The key decision makers involved in e-Commerce activities in the oil, gas
and energy industry demanded an independent, objective and informational
event, programmed by the industry...for the industry. The e-ProCom
Conference Series has answered that call to action with a sold-out
conference and exhibition on June 12-13, 2001 at the George R. Brown
Convention Center.  Houston Technology Center is pleased to be a supporting
sponsor of the conference.  **Mention that HTC referred you to receive a
$100 discount on the conference.**

HTC invites you to join us for TECHfest 2001, which is HTC's Digital Mixer
for the month of June.  An excellent networking opportunity, TECHfest is a
citywide Tech and Energy mixer that will take place on the exhibit floor of
Hall D.  Admission is free of charge and there will be an open bar.  Also,
as a bonus, TECHfest attendees will receive a complimentary guest pass to
the last General Session from 4:00-5:00pm, just before TECHfest.  The topic
of the Session is "Managing Change - We Saves the Best for Last - Lessons
from the Battlefield" and features:  Gary Adams, Lead Partner,
PricewaterhouseCoopers; Rick Sisk, Director of Regulatory Compliance, BP;
John Kennedy, Chief Executive Officer, Wilson Industries; and Lynn Wilson,
