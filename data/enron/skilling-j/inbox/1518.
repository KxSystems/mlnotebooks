Jeff,
Just wanted to mention a couple additional things regarding building a ship here in Turkey. 
If Sherri can forward (perhaps by fax) a copy of the brochure you receive about the "Expedition" vessel, that would be very helpful. Based on what I have heard to date, there is a good shipyard just outside Istanbul -- in a place called Tuzlu -- that builds steel-hulled ships (as opposed to the frou-frou "white" hulled ones). It would be very useful if I dropped by there before I come to Houston, and the brochure would help me visualize better what you have in mind so I can focus my wanderings a bit.
On a related subject, is the "big file" that Bill dropped off too big to copy and send over, or should I just wait until I get to Houston next month?
Good to talk to you yesterday. Looking forward to getting together in Houston soon. 
Say hey to the kids and Rebecca.
Lots of love from all of us here,
Mark
