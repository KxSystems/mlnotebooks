Dear Mr. Skilling:

Thanks very much for the invitation to participate with the energy forum
you are planning and to be one of the commentators at the October 4th
conference.

The forum is an intriguing idea, but under our reporting principles, I
can't have such a relationship with a company I cover. I would like to
attend the October conference if reporters are invited, but I also must
decline the invitation to be one of the speakers.

Enron clearly occupies a unique place in the unfolding energy story--one  I
want to learn a lot more about. I hope there will an opportunity to visit
soon on one of your trips here.


Sincerely yours,



Pete Behr
