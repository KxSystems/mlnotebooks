Mr. Skilling - 
Good afternoon.  I work for Debra Reed, President of SDG&E.  She's asked me to register her for the conference. 
I wanted to ask for a little more clarification...the top portion of the letter mentions participating as a panelist.  The agenda looks pretty complete - is her attendance what you were looking for in terms of participation?  
Please advise.  My phone number if you would prefer is 858-650-6111. 
Thank you.
