Dear Mr. Skilling:

John Adams has asked me to extend his appreciation for the invitation to
attend the Oct. 3-4 energy policy conference in Washington, DC.
Unfortunately, Mr. Adams has a previously scheduled board meeting and
will be unable to participate.  As an alternate, Mr. Adams would like to
suggest Ashok Gupta, who is the Director of NRDC's Energy Program.
Please advise if it would be possible for Mr. Gupta to attend in place
of Mr. Adams.

Thank you.

Sincerely,

Ann Roach
Assistant to the President
