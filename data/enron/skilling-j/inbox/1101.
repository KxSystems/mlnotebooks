Just over two weeks after the tragic and unforgettable events of the 11th
September, we can see that the energy industry, as much as any other, has
had to take stock of itself and all facets of its future direction in the
global marketplace.  One of the immediately apparent effects of the
terrorist attacks is financial uncertainty, which is being felt everywhere,
not just in the United States.  Indeed, the International Monetary Fund has
already forecasted that recovery from the slowdown in the growth of the
global economy has effectively been postponed by several months.

It is clearly vital that everyone in this industry keeps abreast of the
latest developments, which has led us to introduce the new category of
Financial News to the Eyeforenergy website, as well as to our free Daily
News subscription service.  You can subscribe to Daily News here -
http://www.eyeforenergy.com/newsletter.shtml.  Existing subscribers will
automatically have this category added, but there will shortly be a
one-click opt-out link, should you wish to do so.
