In follow up to my note below, KPMG's Director of Investment Consulting will
be in town next Wednesday Aug 22nd.

I have attached our Bear Stearns Stratis Program for your review as well.
Many execs are finding  access to these top money managers and lower fees,
without constant commissions very appealing.

Thank you for your time. <<STRATISpresentation2001-2.ppt>>
