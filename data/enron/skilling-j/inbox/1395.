More Okie Betas
[IMAGE][IMAGE]Here I am 50 years old and what have I done with my life?  We=
ll I do have the Double-Wide , and the little lady Patsy Joe Dale Bob.  And=
 the illegitimate children. Caroline JoeDale Bob on who I spent all my alum=
inum can money , sending her to Boston College, & Holly JoeDale Bob who wil=
l use up the winnings from the chicken fights sending her to college in Sou=
th Carolina, then there is little Tommy Joe Dale Bob who takes after me; he=
 gets the Double wide when I'm gone, and special  Janie Jane Jane Joe Dale =
Bob our baby who works down at the A&W to support our propane usage.   But =
surely there is more to Life.  Had I not consumed all those free beers at G=
ordos I would have had more of those brain cells and I too could have been =
as successful as the Betas that followed me. I feel so inadequate when I am=
 invariably compared to the likes of Strobes,  Dent, Rocky, and you know th=
ere's Drow plus that most successful Clay Coburn.  I will feel like the imp=
udent Senior Citizen I am when Johnny Miller pulls up the Internet link to =
his front-page success article and the others in the class of the class of =
75.  I can only hope Beek, my little brother Bless his heart, will send me =
a Good pornographic joke.

AND Gall Darn It I forgot two other OKIE Betas  Thems Robert Margo , Joe Pa=
rks and Paul Porter.
