Hello Jeff,
Hope all is going great in your world,the street is finally acknowledging
ours. When we last visited I promised to provide you the name and number of
the guy that is training my son and who also trains Jose Cruz Jr. and Ken
Caminetti. Having seen the good, bad and ugly the training world has to
offer I can say with confidence that this guy is something special. His name
is , Blake Blackwell and can be reached at, 281 265 7721 or 713 412 0592.
Hope to see you at the 49er tonight,
Rockn Roll,
Kevin
