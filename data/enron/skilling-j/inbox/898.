Shacklepuss,
    I made the grave error of not checking my email for the past three days
and then pull it up only to find about 4,000 Beta replies to your whiny ass
plea for somebody to talk to.  My theory is you were just feeling very
lonely and blue, and missed some serious homosexual overtures from the bros.
  Well, it worked.....will have to remember that the next time I'm feeling
lonely and blue.

Yours in -kai-,
Drow

PS. Chuckles, can't BELIEVE you actually put your brother's address and
phone number on the website.  If any of these gorillas actually show up and
scratch one of his precious autos or spray paint one of his fricking Van
Gogh's,  he'll just shit!!

At Homecoming 2000, the BETA TENT had the biggest crowd by far.  Stay connected and consider a future homecoming BETA reunion.  It's incredible...forget the 20 years in between...everyone just seems to pick it up right where they left off years ago.
