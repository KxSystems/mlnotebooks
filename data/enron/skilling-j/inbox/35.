Welcome to s+b's enews, an exclusive added-value from strategy+business.

This week: Governments Go Digital: Citizens Get a Direct Connection

New York, April 18, 2001 - Think of public agencies, and stereotypical images include long lines at offices and inattentive bureaucrats. Think again: Governments are using digital technologies to reinvent how they operate, complete with New Economy acronyms like G2G, G2C, and G2B.

Already e-Government initiatives are shaking up public agencies globally, dramatically changing the quality of services in both developed and developing countries. In the U.K., for instance, a single portal connects citizens with services dealing with life transitions, such as having a baby, finding a job, and retiring. In Egypt, the government is teaming up with multinationals to create home-grown high-tech industries and e-skilled college graduates. "Governments need to be built on the principles of quickness, lightness, exactitude, multiplicity, and transparency - the opposite qualities to those we traditionally associate with governments, which have tended to be slow, heavy, vague about their goals, and secretive," said Geoffrey Mulgan, director of the U.K. Cabinet Office's Performance and Innovation Unit. "E-Government plays into the new model."
