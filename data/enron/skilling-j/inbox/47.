Friends,

Most of you know about our company ValueScience Corporation, though for some
this is an introduction.  We have been "at it" for two years now, and have
created a really special company dedicated to developing world class tools
to unravel the mystery of building shareholder value.  We have attached a
very brief overview and FAQ which will help fill in some of the blanks, but
suffice it that we are setting out to completely change the basis on which
companies are valued, the way that we understand stock market behavior, and
the tools by which Senior Management sets priorities, allocates scarce
resources, and values transactions (e.g., M&A, private equity, IPOs,
technology acquisition)

Please expect us to begin communicating routinely to you about ValueScience,
comments on recent market events, insights about trends in value drivers in
key markets, etc..

Cheers,

Bob
