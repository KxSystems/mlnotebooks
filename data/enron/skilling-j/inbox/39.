    Thursday, April 19, 2001 Issue 26   EDITORIAL  It's been a busy few wee=
ks  It's been a busy two weeks in the energy sector, since our last newslet=
ter.  The Intercontinental Exchange is rumored to have made an offer for th=
e IPE, and NYMEX has started offering new products to compete with IPE's tr=
aditional markets.  The California energy crisis continues to rack up victi=
ms with another utility declaring bankruptcy.   Conoco's refinery explosion=
 has caused a spike in prices, and Enron and Dynergy have both reported rec=
ord earnings.   As you can imagine with everything going on, we had a hard =
time focusing on just one issue for this edition of the Briefing.  Instead,=
 we decided to give you a bit of everything-some e-business news with a loo=
k at what NexClear's up to; a look at online trading; and an overview of pr=
ivatization efforts in Latin America.  So take a look and let us know what =
you think-is Latin America the next big growth spot on the energy market?  =
Is online energy trading going to be the thing that takes the energy sector=
 from laggard to front-runner in e-commerce adoption?  How viable are green=
 energies-are they the future or just a blip?  Let us know.   One final not=
e.  Our American readers will no doubt be aware of next week's Earth Day (o=
ur non-American readers might be struck by the irony of Americans celebrati=
ng Earth Day considering some of President Bush's recent stances).  The ent=
ire Eyeforenergy team would like to wish everyone out there a happy, and en=
vironmentally friendly Earth Day (and of course take a moment to plug our u=
pcoming Green Energy Conference in November-keep your eye out for informati=
on; and let you know about our new site we'll be launching in about 2 weeks=
:  www.eyeforfuelcells.com that will focus on the commercial applications o=
f fuel cells)    --Allison Robertshaw, Editor    CASE STUDY   The Race is O=

ty trading in the United States and OTC commodity clearing in Europe, NexCl=
ear, Inc., Boulder, Colo., is one of three known companies gunning to be th=
e first to offer complete OTC clearing services in the United States  "Curr=
ently, no one offers OTC clearing product there," says Roger Kristiansen, d=
irector of NexClear's European operations.  "A few firms, such as the Londo=

 interest swaps, but no firm has yet to offer anything close to a... Click =

 lines are being drawn in the continuing battle over the future of futures =
as Atlanta-based Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) made a bid for London's In=
ternational Petroleum Exchange (IPE). The offer valued at US $65 million (4=
5 million pound) has apparently won the approval of Man Financial, the brok=
erage division of Man Group Plc., which holds 10 percent of the IPE. Oil gi=
ant BP is reportedly also in favor of the offer.  The offer, as presented t=
o IPEs board, is said to comprise a combination of ICE stock, shares in the=
 merged entity and a new second class of share. IPE's market capitalization=
 was last valued at ?29.9m ($43m), after shares were suspended on Monday. I=
CE is estimated to be worth about $1.3bn.... Click here for Full Story     =
 INSIGHT   Insight: Privatization of Latin America   The privatization of a=
 state-owned industry is a development of historic dimension. For many Lati=
n America nations, their formerly state owned energy companies represent th=
eir largest investment. For much of the world former global giants such as =
British Petroleum, British Gas, Petro Canada, Elf Aquatine (France), ENI (I=
taly), TOTAL (France) and Reposal (SPAIN), have recently undergone the tran=
sition from state ownership to at least partial private ownership.  Eye on =
the prize   With an eye on the prize that could spell billions in new inves=
tments, privatization efforts are underway everywhere from the former Sovie=
t Union to Latin America. For Latin America, in particular, the move toward=
