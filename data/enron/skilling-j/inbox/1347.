Join me at our exciting and informative seminar on Tuesday, September 11th
focused on valuing your business.  This is the first luncheon in a
three-part series on raising venture capital.  "What is My Company REALLY
Worth" will address the mistakes founders make in negotiating valuations
with angels and seed stage venture capitalists.  Entrepreneurs will have the
opportunity to hear the panelists' perspectives on what early stage
companies are worth in today's market BEFORE they get to the table.
Following this seminar on valuation, HTC will present "Series B and Beyond"
on October 23 and "Closing the Deal" on November 13.



Registration and networking start at 11:00 a.m., with the luncheon
continuing promptly at 11:30 a.m.  The program will begin at noon and will
end at 1:30 p.m. sharp.



The seminar will feature Bryan Emerson, President of Starlight Capital, as
moderator, with panelists Glen Blackmon, Angel Investor; William Frazier,
Senior Managing Director of Howard Frazier Barker Elliott, Inc.; Marc
Geller, Managing Director of Sternhill Partners; and Martin Lindenberg,
M.D.,

Chairman & CEO of Xeotron Corp.
