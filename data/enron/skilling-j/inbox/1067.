Woody,
Good work on making contact with Joe Parks and successfully recruiting
him as a new member of EWooglin.com.
On the strength of your success, I started searching the Internet and
Louisville for Caldwell Willig.  The last time I saw him was in NYC in
the late seventies...the result of a chance meeting on the street after a
get together of metropolitan area Betas.  Zeebs will remember.  It was
the night I told the Long Island duck joke at a crowed restaurant in his
home town (inhibitions were low as usual).
"Where is Caldwell Willig?"  Is this our Caldwell Willig
(http://louisville.bcentral.com/louisville/stories/1998/08/03/story6.html
), or is our Caldwell a "Jr.", "II", "III" or 'IV"?
Any insight brothers?...let me know.

Beek

At Homecoming 2000, the BETA TENT had the biggest crowd by far.  Stay connected and consider a future homecoming BETA reunion.  It's incredible...forget the 20 years in between...everyone just seems to pick it up right where they left off years ago.
