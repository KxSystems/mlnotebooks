All right Shack.  The picture is making me respond to these diatribes, seeing how my puss is front and center in the photo.  (By the way how many of you old farts from '75 can name the others in the picture?) 
I get the impression that you all think -kai- is dead among the class of '76.  That is absolute bulls**t!  I still see many of my pledge brothers on a regular basis as well as many of you "older" Betas.  (Had dinner with John Miller last night - and he even paid!) 
My home has always been and will always be open to any Beta who gets his ass to Dallas (except Drow cause he's already here). 
In fact, the SMU class of '76 is indeed hosting a stunning event for alums this Saturday night at the Highland Park estate (on Beverly Drive) of some SAE that I never heard of (apparently a member of the "lucky sperm club")  There will be valet parking and more SAE and Phi Delt alums than you can shake a stick at.  They will be all sitting around with their trophy wifes talking about the size of their Porches and bond portfolios (since they all got out of the stock market 18 months ago).  All this for only 75 bucks.  Hmmm, do I want to go there and enjoy a lovely evening with my fellow classmates, or do I want to walk over one block to Mark Paul's and listen to you whiners that have the wherewithall to make it to Dallas bitch and moan about the '76 pledge class.  Could be a tough decision. 
If it wasn't for Beek and Elvis last year, I suspect that you members of the '75 class would have been sitting at home watching reruns of Cartoon Carnival (right Arends?). 
Just remember it was the wisdom and vision of all you whiners that put the guys in that picture together (right C-Paul?)  So quit bitchin and get to Dallas this weekend.  We'll figure out something fun to do!

Before eWooglin there was a loose network of Betas exchanging emails with pics of the bros in their glory days.The bros in the attached picture are hereby duty-bound to extend the greatness of Gamma Omega.  Now get to it maggots.-kai-Shack

 Boys: I would like to nominate Elvis for the greatest single email in the first year of ewooglin.com. The stuff about 76ers and worms and geese and Ojedas and the "onlyest ewooglin.com" and the first dorg ever in University Park is the best shit I've read in a long time. And I'm a fucking writer. Any clicks? Dent

 Yes, Elvis is still alive and reading these pussy-ass messages. To the class of 76-so, where are the freaking parties this weekend. You 76ers are still worms. Last year the class of 75 held the only DORG recorded in University Park history; initiated the firstest and onlyest EWogolin.com; manned a Beta tent with more people than the class of 74, 75 & 76 combined; were banned from O'jedas for 1 year for just being us and still had room for cocktails at the Mules house on Sunday morning. 
You guys are pathetic - No worse, you guys are geese.

At Homecoming 2000, the BETA TENT had the biggest crowd by far.  Stay connected and consider a future homecoming BETA reunion.  It's incredible...forget the 20 years in between...everyone just seems to pick it up right where they left off years ago.
