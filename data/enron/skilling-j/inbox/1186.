Dear Mr. Skilling,

Please accept my invitation to visit Carlton Woods in The Woodlands.  This
will be a great opportunity for you and your family to come inside the
gates for a first hand look.

Carlton Woods is the only guard gated, private country club neighborhood
The Woodlands has ever created.  Along with a private Jack Nicklaus
Signature golf course, the neighborhood will boast amenities never before
seen in this part of the Houston area.

You'll have the opportunity to view over 30 homes under construction in
various stages.  Homes for sale in Carlton Woods range in price from the
high 400s up to over 2 million.  We also have an excellent selection of
homesites available for purchase with no time frame to build.

If you would like a Carlton Woods discovery package mailed to you, please
respond to this E-Mail and I will send one to you.

Regards,

Haynes Reynolds
