Hi everyone-- greetings to all. I hope you are well and enjoying your
summer!  I wanted to let you know that the process is complete and my
appointment to the corporate board of directors for GridSouth Transco, LLC
is confirmed.  GST is a new regional transmission organization, formed under
the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's Order 2000, which encourages
creation of larger electric power market areas in the U.S.  GST will operate
the transmission assets of Duke Energy, Carolina Power & Light (Progress
Energy) and SCANA (South Carolina Electric & Gas), with 22,000 miles of
transmission lines connected to approximately 34,500 megawatts of electric
generation serving more than 3.75 million customers in North Carolina and
South Carolina.  This appointment is in addition to and apart from my duties
here at the Institute, but a great opportunity for us to get a good look at
how the electric power industry is being re-shaped.  The board begins
operation next September.  For more information about GridSouth, you can
