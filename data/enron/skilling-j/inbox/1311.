    Thursday, September 06, 2001 Issue 36   EDITORIAL  Consumers, Consolida=
tion, and Cocktails                                                        =
                  It's been an interesting week for the energy industry.  A=
 number of recent announcements hint at some long term changes in the way t=
he energy industry will look 15 years from now.  International Fuel Cells  =
have announced that Woking, UK will be the home of the first commercial fue=
l cell in the UK (for more information on this story see the article below)=
, and Puget Sound Energy  is extending their conservation program that take=
s advantage of real-time pricing for consumers.  It would seem that the lon=
g-promised benefits of fuel cells are turning the corner and are beginning =
to offer a viable commercial alternative.  Consumers are soon to be faced w=
ith even more options on where they get their power from, and with the incr=
easingly ability of utilities to pass on the real costs and benefits of the=
ir power choices, their choice will be an important one.  It opens up a wor=
ld where consumers will develop a relationship with their power supplier as=
 they're forced to look at where they get their power from and when they us=
e it.  It's been a while in the making, and it seems that the recent power =
crises in the States have given it the push it needed to turn the corner.  =
 As dramatically as the downstream and retail side of the energy industry i=
s set to change in the next 12 months, the wholesale energy market continue=
s to face almost daily changes.  One of the articles in this week's briefin=
g is an interview  with Canada's Watt-Ex.  It would seem that while cross U=
S-Canadian energy trading is developing apace, there are still a number of =
hurdles on both sides of the fence to be overcome.  Recent announcements at=
 Enron in the past week or two, suggest that Energy's golden boy is having =
a few teething problems... is this the opportunity for rivals like the ICE,=
 TradeSpark, and Dynegy to consolidate their recent gains?  And what does i=
t mean for exchanges like HoustonStreet and RedMeteor that have been strugg=
ling of late?  There's a lot of talk about consolidation and it seems to be=
 picking up steam...   On a final note, you probably know that the Eyeforen=
ergy team is going to be down in New Orleans next week for our Energy Excha=
nges Online II event.  We look forward to seeing some familiar faces and me=
eting some new ones down there, as well as getting all the latest news over=
 a hurricane or two.   See you in the Big Easy...                          =
                                  --Allison Robertshaw, Editor    Q&A   Ene=
rgy Without Borders       The web revolution is in full swing and it has hi=
t the energy sector full force. Despite an economic slowdown in the United =
States and other areas of the globe, energy companies continue to flock hea=
dfirst to the Internet. Recently Forrester Research published a well-read r=
eport, "Net Energy Hits Hypergrowth", that predicts online energy trading w=
ill exceed $3.5 trillion by 2005.  While the online energy trading world is=
 dominated by the likes of EnronOnline , with a reported average daily trad=
ing volume of $3.5 billion, TradeSpark , IntercontinentialExchange...      =

rget       As deregulation and competition sweep the globe, there is an eve=
r-increasing demand being placed on utilities and energy providers to gathe=
r, manage, analyze and distribute data in creative ways.  Widespread merger=
s, consolidation, sell offs and closings have marked the past year, as the =
online energy marketplace has evolved. In the midst of this energy market u=
pheaval, a crop of new Web-based businesses, products and services has emer=
ged to reduce the complexity of deregulation and help manage the pain of sk=
yrocketing energy prices.  Exchanges that started life with one product lin=
e aimed at a small group of users, traders and marketers have evolved to th=
e point where they give new meaning to the word "power". Today's exchanges =
serve up a wide range of products from electricity, natural gas, crude oil,=
 refined products,...      Click here for Full Story      ADVERTISEMENT  [I=
