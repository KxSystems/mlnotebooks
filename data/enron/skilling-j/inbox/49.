Hey TEAM!  Here's a great offer from Bill LaFuze, Vinson & Elkins, Team Enron's  newest team member.  He's made this offer to the team:  He wants to save two of you tired riders from the long ride home by offering a seat on his private airplane. 

Read on, and let me know if you're interested:  

"I am an instument rated pilot (am working on a commercial rating and have passed the commercial written test), and own an airplane (Cessna 210Turbo). I am willing to make this challenge to the Enron team."

"In order to avoid the long, and perhaps dreary bus ride back to Houston, I now intend to have my airplane flown to Austin to pick me up and can offer seats to the two Enron teammembers who raise the most pledge money for MS, who make it to Austin, and who are willing to travel in a 6 seater private aircraft. Travel time is about 47 minutes to Sugarland airport where my plane is based.  I can make a stop at West Houston airport (I10 and Hwy 6) for the convenience of anyone who might prefer that destination. Sorry, my plane does not have an external bike rack, nor adequate room in the luggage compartment, so bikes would still need to come back by bus."

THANKS BILL !!
