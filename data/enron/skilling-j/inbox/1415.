Jeff,
 
Congratulations!--on  your amazing successes and your uncanny ability to make good  decisions.  I've always held you in the highest regard for being the  smartest person I ever worked with.  I'm certain it's been a tough few  weeks as you wrestled with your choice.  In a small way I can relate and if  others were willing to speak out you would find that you're far from  alone.
 
Nine years ago this  month you and I met in McKinsey's Dallas office to discuss my role with  Enron upon its acquisition of Access.  I maintained that my  employment agreement must have an escape clause to prevent me from being  transferred to Houston.  You were understandably surprised and  suggested that my career opportunities would be limited if I stayed in  Dublin.  Having recently been divorced I knew that if I left the city  where my then 14 and 15 year old sons lived with their mother I would  never be able to continue the father/sons relationship which was so  important to me.  When I met with Ken Lay a few weeks later, he too  seemed surprised that I wasn't going to join the management team in  Houston.
 
I don't know what  might have happened in my career had I not made that choice.  Perhaps  the politics in Houston would have done me in since I was truly a small  company entrepreneur.  But, when I compare myself to my then  peers, Lou, Mark, Ken and later Cliff, Andy and Kevin, I do  believe I was/am their intellectual equal.  Thus, I may have paid  an extremely high financial price for my personal choice.  Regrets?   On the contrary, my ex-wife moved away so I actually was able to raise my  sons, both of whom are doing great (One graduated from Washington University and  lives in San Francisco and the other graduates from Florida State this  December).  I also wouldn't have ended up with Sue and gained four more  kids.  I adopted the youngest--now nearly 11.  I also watched the  births of my two grandchildren and my step-son is trading emissions for  Enron.  
 
So, I react to  your decision with respect and admiration.  I really learned from Sue,  whose workaholic late husband died at 42, that life truly is too short.   We're enjoying ours and I hope you will too.  But, with only one child  left at home we're ready to move to warmer climes.  If you decide to change  the world again, even if on a smaller scale this time, and would like some help,  give me a call.  Best of luck.
 
Regards,
 
Lance
