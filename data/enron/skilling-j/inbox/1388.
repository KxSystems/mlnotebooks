Bonnie and I just got back from vacation to learn that you are leaving
Enron.  This has to be a major transition for you and if I can be of help in
any way, please call.  I'm sure there will be lot's of "noise" and people
talking to you about options, but I hope you will take some time for
yourself to slow down and reflect a little --- you still have a lot of life
to live and this can  be a terrific breather to refocus on what you value.
Good Luck to you and  let me know  if I can help.  God Bless.   --- David
