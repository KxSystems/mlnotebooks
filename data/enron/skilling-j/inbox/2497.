Forget The Undefeated for the time being. Buy  SmackNabb's book first. Then transport the author to Norman to blow up David  Boren's house. Yeee-haw.
 
By the way, Brother Storthz, a trip to Houston is a  possibility. Soon. Tell Hohl.

Space,
 
I saw my fellow Arkie, Dent, at a book  signing in downtown Houston during "The Junction Boys" tour. When are you  coming back to H-town for the new book, Jim? Can I buy you a  refreshment?
 
By the way, Dent is not the only author in our  ranks. Written under the pen name, SmackNabb, I have a Beta big brother who is  going throughout Texas hawking his new book, "The Complete Infidel's Guide to  Radical Islam". 
 
 If your local bookstore is out of stock,  buy Dent's book.

Attached is the annual Beta Theta Pi wives  tribute to Scott McNabb held at all homecoming football games.  I am  sorry I missed this years event  but I was visiting my home state  watching Nebraska #1 beat Oklahoma #2 ...not that anyone cares.   Oh by the way Mr. Dent is doing a great job hocking his book up here in  Oklahoma.  Yesterday I heard him on talk radio KTOK where he was  signing books and predicting Oklahoma to beat Tulsa 106 to 0.  He  didn't miss it by much.  Oh another by the way we need more Betas from  the class of 73 commenting as my gag reflex is getting to much of a  workout from the class of 71. Love Space  456   I think  Ulrich was 438 #1 in our pledge class.Oh for older Oh Fos monitoring this  WOOGLIN site my brother in law John Evans Petree  # 355 had his second  grandchild last month.

At  Homecoming 2000, the BETA TENT had the biggest crowd by far.  Stay  connected and consider a future homecoming BETA reunion.  It's  incredible...forget the 20 years in between...everyone just seems to pick it  up right where they left off years ago.
