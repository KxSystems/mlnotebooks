An inactive employee, that had you listed as their last supervisor, has invoices that require coding, issue resolution, or approval.  These invoices have been routed to your iPayit inbox because you are listed as the employee's last supervisor.  Please logon to iPayit and take the appropriate action to resolve these invoices.
