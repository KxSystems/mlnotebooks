Drow:

Congratulations on Joe. At least one of your kids likes you.

How is the BBQ joint coming? Have you finished The Undefeated. If so, would
you mind applying your literary mind to a book review for Amazon.com? Feel
free to tell everyone just how great I used to be, still am, and how I led
the Betas in receiving yards, touchdowns and sheer leadership ability for
three straight seasons. Well, if you don't feel like doing that, just tell
'em how great the book is.

Brother Dent
