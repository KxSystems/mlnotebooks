IBM Global Insurance Executive Conference
Hotel Inter-Continental, Berlin, Germany
October 3-5, 2001

- This event is IBM Global Insurance Industry's premier customer event, and
provides
a forum for exploring new growth and e-business opportunities in the
changing
financial services world. It is a spouse event with a planned social and
partner program.

- You are requested to speak for 45 minutes including a short question and
answer period
on October 4 (or October 3 if it is more convenient). We'd like you to talk
about the
Enron growth story, discussing how Enron has changed the face of the energy
industry.
We think the executives will be interested to learn how innovation and
investment coupled
with an entrepreneurial strategy has worked to make Enron one of the most
highly respected
companies in the world. In addition, we'd like you to discuss Enron's role
in financial services
as you create and participate in e-markets for a variety of goods and
services. Since insurance
companies are increasingly playing in energy risk management, in weather
risk management
and other areas, these insurance and financial services executives ought to
have significant
interest in your addressing Enron's leadership in this area as well.

- Anticipated audience is 100-125 CEOs and senior business executives from
major insurance
and financial services companies around the globe, plus accompanying IBM
hosts.
There should be ample opportunity to network.

- If you would like, we will provide professionals to assist you with your
content and presentation.

- You and your spouse are guests of IBM.

- This event receives media coverage from many European dailies and
periodicals, including
Financial Times, Handelsblatt, Les Echos and usually especially strong
coverage from the Nordics,
so we can facilitate an Enron story, if you'd like.

- On a personal note, Berlin is an amazing city (4X the size of Paris) with
a wealth of history
spanning 800 years. Our partner program is designed with exclusive tours.
The gala dinner
Thursday evening will be spectacular.

- Attached is a brochure, and I can provide a hardcopy version, from our
conference last year
in Barcelona. We plan to do something similar this year. It was an insert
in the American Banker
and insurance trade magazines.
