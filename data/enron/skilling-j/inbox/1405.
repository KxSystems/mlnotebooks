Brothers in -kai-
 
just to let you know that I changed my email  address, so if you have any questions or problems with yahoogroups and want to  send me something directly and not to all the guys in the group you can send it  to shackleton@austin.rr.com 
 
Also, I'm attaching the current email member list  so you can update your individual address books.  
 
Note on this list that there are a couple of  updates.  
JGlass is now found jglass@northelginteleport.com 
Elvis  Thompson changed his email address to elvisthompson@aol.com 
I'll remove the old addresses if J and Elvis give  the OK.
 
I see lots of new message traffic  lately.   Mostly from Okies and southeast Texans. Must be the hot  weather has them inside on their PC's.  But it is a good time now to  plan the autumn Beta mini-reunions.
 
I read the news about Rocky's resignation Tuesday.   The word is out that they had to put old Skilling in the witness protection  program so the California attorney general couldn't find him and throw him in a  jail cell with Spike after Spike does Ken Lay. Jeez, you can't even sell  gas nowadays without pissing off the California politburo.  Rocky will  probably surface in Turkey or something (JKS - say hey to your blood brother  Mark there)
