Mr. Skilling,

Thank you so much for delivering my resume to your Associate Program
recruiting personnel.  I have been in contact with them for the last couple
weeks, and recently confirmed an interview date for Wednesday, May 23rd.

I am very excited about the possibility of joining Enron and look forward to
a challenging visit next week.  It would be an honor to become a member of
your prestigious team.

Again, I greatly appreciate your time and assistance.  You have been a great
help.  Have a wonderful week and congratulations on all your continued
success!


Sincerely,

Jon Friedberg
