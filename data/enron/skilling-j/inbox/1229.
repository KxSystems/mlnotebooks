Dear Jeff,

I & my family  are deeply disturbed by the cowardly attack on America.  It
has been extremely painful to watch such acts of crime.  This is the gravest
tragedy we have come across in our lives.

America is the richest democracy in the world & India the largest.  We enjoy
freedom & no amount of terrorist act can shake our foundations.  Terrorism
is the biggest danger to humanity & let us bravely fight to end these
barbaric acts.

Like America, India has been suffering cross border terrorism for more than
2 decades.  Along with you, we feel & suffer from such brutal pains &
sorrows.  Our arms reach out for all the families who were victims of this
dastardly attack.

I sincerely hope your family, friends & colleagues are safe & are recovering
from their worst nightmare.  In the true spirit of YPOer, we all pray to
give you, your family & America strength to bear the loss of fellow
citizens.

Today, all of us at home & office stood in silent homage.

With sympathy & warm regards,


J.K. Jhaver & Manjulika
