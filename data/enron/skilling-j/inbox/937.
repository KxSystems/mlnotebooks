     Friday, October 19, 2001 Issue 39   EDITORIAL  Weathering Risk   This =
week's Briefing is concerned with risk, chiefly that presented by weather i=
n the face of newly deregulated (re-regulated?) energy markets.  Our main f=
eature explains how susceptible the industry has become to increasingly vol=
atile weather, and how the plethora of risks which become presented (includ=
e those directly related to earnings) can be alleviated by trading a portfo=
lio of weather derivatives.  We also outline some of the companies who are =
already emerging as major players in what is already becoming an essential =
tool for managing financial risk.   On a broader note, our second feature o=
utlines approaches to managing risk in general, and how energy companies ca=
n identify and consolidate new opportunities, and reap real financial benef=
it from minimal risk.   Also, this week saw Eyeforenergy's conference in Si=
ngapore, which has been a resounding success.  In a future issue of the Bri=
efing, we will bring you details of events as they unfolded at this three-d=
ay meeting of some of the most influential and forward-thinking companies a=
nd organizations in the Asian energy market.  For now, you can apply for un=
limited access to the speakers' presentations at this conference - more det=
ails are available here .   -- Bruno Russell, Acting Editor      FOCUS   We=
ather is Risky Business for Energy Providers   The pathway to economic obli=
vion is paved with the bleached bones of those that failed to manage risk. =
It has been said that economic history is the history of people learning to=
 manage risk. As deregulation takes root, power providers are spreading the=
ir reach to the far corners of the globe, in an effort to minimize their ri=
sk in any given market.  You don't need a quick trip to Las Vegas to realiz=
e that the laws of probability are alive and well in the energy sector. Eve=
n the most basic of economic indicators; things that once seemed unpredicta=
ble, crop harvest, storms, war, famine, the flow of capital can all be fore=
cast with some degree... Click here for Full Story      INSIGHT   Managing =
Risk, "That Old Black Magic"   Headlines coming out of the energy sector ar=
e hard to escape. One company reports record profits, another record losses=
, another goes belly up, yet even more merge, acquire, form alliances, expa=
nd, contract and jockey for position as deregulation and increasing competi=
tion in energy markets thrust them from a historically stable, low risk env=
ironment into a brave new world, full of ever changing risk and opportuniti=
es.  Add to the mix shareholders screaming for more profits, consumers dema=
nding lower prices, regulators hell bent on proving deregulation is a myth;=
 there is only re-regulation in a new world order. With this dislocation, t=
he first issue for shareholders and managers of the affected companies to c=
ome... Click here for Full Story      ADVERTISEMENT  [IMAGE] Eyeforenergy G=
