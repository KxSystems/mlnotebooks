Dear Erin,

On behalf of Jeff Skilling, the endorsement, name and title, as slightly edited for stylistic consistency by your manuscript editor,   look fine!

Again, on behalf of Jeff, thank you for your interest in him and Enron.  We look forward to receiving a copy of the book!

Let me know if I can help in any other way.

Best regards!

Christie.

Dear Ms. Patrick,

Thank you very much for providing an endorsement for Expectations Investing
by Al Rappaport and Michael Mauboussin. We really appreciate receiving Mr.
Skilling's thoughtful comments. We will plan to use the comments on the book
jacket, the front page, or in some cases, in other promotional materials.

Our manuscript editor has suggested the following edit to the comments for
style consistency with the rest of the work. Could you please review the
revised endorsement below and determine if it meets with your approval?

Also, please confirm the name and title as you wish them to appear with the
endorsement:

"Expectations Investing reinvents today's investment market architecture. .
. . A valuable tool for the innovative investor."

-Jeff Skilling, CEO, Enron Corp.


I would really appreciate it if you could please send me an email
(ekorey@hbsp.harvard.edu) or fax (617-783-7489) confirming your approval as
soon as you have reviewed the edited endorsement.  If I have not heard from
you by Monday, July 2, I will assume that the changes meet with your
approval.

Once again, many thanks for your support of Expectations Investing. I will
send you a copy of the finished book as soon as it becomes available.

Sincerely,
Erin
