 heart of our  festivities. For you or a loved one far away, we've assemble=
d  a grand Thanksgiving selection sure to speak of these warm, wonderful  h=
oliday traditions.   Calyx & Corolla creates luxurious style with Thanksgiv=
ing-inspired  touches. Couture  Cornucopia  (shown right) is a true tableto=
p tradition set  to be a focal point in the holiday home. Our enchanting mo=
ss-covered  cornucopia brims with autumn?s bounty.  Nothing is cherished mo=
re than the feast upon the Thanksgiving  table. Celebrate your family meal =
with the added beauty of our  Harvest  Centerpiece . It?s an eye-catching c=
ollection of nuts,  leaves, branches and herbs designed to show from every =
angle.  If adding ambience to the air is your desire than you?re  sure to l=

he  bounty of the fields.  The fall flower of the moment, Red  Rover Mums ,=
 is the emblematic floral choice this holiday.  With their dramatic shades =
of rusty red streaked with gold your  guests will be impressed by this glow=
