HEY TEAM - CONGRATULATIONS !!!  TEAM ENRON, the growing wonder of the cycling world, has done it again!!  We successfully completed another MS150.  The great weather, fabulous volunteer support, and team camaraderie made it the best ever.   I can still see those Enron jerseys whizzing by,  and it seems there was always an Enron jersey in sight both days.  The advantage for me in starting first is that within a couple of hours, I get to see all 9,000 riders as they pass by, and no matter how many years I've done this, it's still a thrill to be part of such an awesome event.
  
Thanks to Jeff Skilling, CEO of Enron Corp., for setting such a fine example for the team by riding all the way to Austin.  He is now a veteran of the 1998, 1999, 2000 and 2001 Tours.  He looked really good on his new bike, wearing the infamous #1 on his helmet....and he beat his own best time into Austin with a12:00p arrival!

Other notable performances:

Mark Muller
&
Dan Leff
(In memory of Mark Muller's father whose birthday was April 21)
straight through from Houston to Austin, arriving 3:15p on Saturday
(not that I would take their word for this remarkable feat, but I have an eye-witness)
