=09=09New Power Plants to be a key focus of Power Markets  2002  Richard Ch=
eney has said we need a new power plant every week in order  to meet growin=
g demand.  In fact, the industry is doing that and  more!    But powerplant=
 construction is never simple, and always affected with  public policy.    =
This year's edition of Power Markets 2002 in Washington, D.C.  will provide=
 the information you need to benefit from opportunities  created by the boo=
m in powerplant construction:    * Lynn Church, President of the Electric P=
ower Supply  Association, will introduce the topic with a discussion of tod=
ay's  unique opportunities for merchant power.    * Joe Colvin, President a=
nd CEO of the Nuclear Energy Institute  will discuss the continuing, and gr=
owing role of nuclear  power.   The nuclear fleet has never delivered more =
energy  to the national grid, and the future hasn't looked this good for nu=
clear  construction in decades.    * John O'Brien, Skipping Stone, will dis=
cuss recent  experiences in the construction of coal-fired plants.   Coal  =
is still by far the dominant fuel for power generation in the U.S., and  sh=
ows no signs of giving up that status.    * PG&E National Energy Group will=
 provide a presentation on  gas-fired generation.   By far the dominant cat=
egory of  powerplant currently under construction, gas-fired plants are fas=
t  becoming the incremental resource.     * Buck Buckner, Director of Marke=
ting, Stewart &  Stevenson, will address distributed generation opportuniti=
es  spawned by shortfalls in transmission and distribution investment.    B=
ut the Conference is not just about powerplants.  It will also  cover: * re=
tail markets * telecom and energy convergence * transmission  policy * cred=
it risk * commodity exchanges * career trends and more!    And don't miss o=
ur pre-conference seminar: FUNDAMENTALS OF POWER  MARKETING on October 15, =
2001.    Warmest Regards,  Glenn Lovin  Executive Director    P.S.  There a=
re a few slots available for exhibitors.  See  brochure for details.    Cli=
