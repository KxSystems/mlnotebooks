John -- Jeff Skilling asked me to forward the attached materials that he mentioned to you yesterday.  Ken Lay discussed this comprehensive solution to California's energy crisis last week with a group of San Jose CEOs -- Dan Scheinman attended on your behalf.   As a result of that meeting, we drafted the attached letter for CEOs to send to the Governor and following legislators:
	Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg
	Senate President Pro Tem John Burton
	Assembly Speaker Pro Tem Fred Keeley
	Assembly Republican Leader Dave Cox
	Senate Republican Leader Jim Brulte
	Senator Debra Bowen
		

If you have any questions, please give Ken or Jeff a call.

Thank you.
