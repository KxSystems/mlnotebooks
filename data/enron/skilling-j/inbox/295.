Free Opera in the Park featuring Houston Grand Opera's Carmen, June 8-10!
Houston Grand Opera's sensational Multimedia Modular Stage production returns for three FREE performances at Houston's Miller Outdoor Theatre on June 8-10 at 8:30 p.m. Bizet's fiery gypsy Carmen, everybody's favorite femme fatale, ignites the summer in a powerhouse production that had audiences and critics cheering when it was first unveiled in 1998.

Houston Grand Opera's revolutionary Multimedia Modular Stage (MMS), with its giant "live" video screens, hydraulic platforms, and hundreds of rotating, colored lights takes the incredible energy onstage and transports it to the farthest reaches of the outdoor venue with a visceral impact equal to that of a rock concert!

Tickets for the reserved seating will be issued between the hours of 11:30am and 1:00pm through the Miller Theatre box office on the day of the performance.  Any remaining tickets will be issued one hour before the performance.

For additional information, visit HGO's web site at www.houstongrandopera.org. Also see volunteer opportunities below.
