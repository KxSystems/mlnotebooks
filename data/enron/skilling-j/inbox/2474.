Brothers oh brothers,
   Let's see, we have Dent and Miller a feuding and they both live in
Oklahoma so who really gives a shit anyway?  We've got Beta's older than me
re-acquainting themselves with each other an STILL lying about their grade
points.  We've got fricking Wilson Jones mentions on this line??????   Have
some standards boys.  Should have handled that little weasel myself for
giving pledges dorg secrets back in 74.  All that's missing is Rob Rossell
chiming in with his famous pledge court quote, "Mr. Dent has been out to
personally hang my ass ever since I accepted the bid" and the circle would
be complete eh?

PS.  If you homos don't hear from me as often, fret not.  I finally broke
down and came out of early retirement and cranked up the revenue machine
again.  I'll still be looking in, promise.

At Homecoming 2000, the BETA TENT had the biggest crowd by far.  Stay connected and consider a future homecoming BETA reunion.  It's incredible...forget the 20 years in between...everyone just seems to pick it up right where they left off years ago.
