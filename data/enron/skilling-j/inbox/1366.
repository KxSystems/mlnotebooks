Mr. Skilling,

I am sending information to the printer this afternoon for our new brochure
and picture book for The Business Council.  I was wondering if we should
just list you as a Graduate member and list you as Former President & CEO of
Enron Corp. and keep the same business address and phone numbers.  Please
let me know asap.

Thanks.
