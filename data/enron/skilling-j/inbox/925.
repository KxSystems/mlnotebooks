Brothers,
It has come to my attention that either our YahooGroup is not working,
or you are not communicating.  So this message is a Search for
ExtraTerrestial Intelligence among the select Betas that make up this
august group. I will even count terrestial intelligence this time.

What with Homecoming only 5 days away, we figured there would be some
message traffic on eWooglin.

Hit reply when you see this message to let me know if there is life
out there.

At Homecoming 2000, the BETA TENT had the biggest crowd by far.  Stay connected and consider a future homecoming BETA reunion.  It's incredible...forget the 20 years in between...everyone just seems to pick it up right where they left off years ago.
