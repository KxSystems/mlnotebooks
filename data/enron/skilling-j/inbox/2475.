I'm sure you probably won't hear any crude jokes  at your expense having to do with one hand, applying too much pressure, etc.  This group is too sensitive and caring for that. On the flip side, you won't  have to shovel any snow for six weeks....and I understand there's an inch  down  in Southern VT as we speak.

I forgot George was you LITTLE brother with a  higher roll #. Since we now know that Smack-Nabb / Donkey was #457 , George  was # 462 , Space #456, Strap Anderson #455, Rag-Man Stewart #454, who was  #458,#459, #461 ? Or more likely, who cares ?

HAPPY HOLLOWEEN  FROM SAMURAIMAI  (#457 CLASS OF  '73)                          
  Regarding U T winning the national championship.  What a  JOKE!  I have 
arranged to have the "JUNIOR COLLEGE'S" TOWER here  in Austin demolished, as 
it is the preferred site for the proposed  Blanton Museum.  The tower will 
never glow orange again.   It's also on the second tier target list for the 
raghead's next  flyby.
Best regards.  -KAI-
At Homecoming 2000,  the BETA TENT had the biggest crowd by far.  Stay connected and  consider a future homecoming BETA reunion.  It's incredible...forget  the 20 years in between...everyone just seems to pick it up right where  they left off years ago.
