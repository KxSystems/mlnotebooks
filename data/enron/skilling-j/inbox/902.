[IMAGE]=09 [IMAGE]     Dear Jeff Skilling,   Selecting the right gift or se=
asonal accent to adorn your home  or office is made easy with our original =
bouquets, orchids and  preserved designs. Each of these intriguing items ha=
s its own  character and ambience and is meant to complement the good life.=
   Take our Orchid  Blaze Bouquet  (shown right) for example. With its fier=
y orange  orchids and black matte vase, it makes the perfect seasonal cente=
rpiece.  This eye-catching bouquet is easy to arrange too.   The Colmanara =
 Orchid Plant  is quite possibly the most exciting new orchid  to be introd=
uced in the last decade. This alluring orchid, nicknamed  ?Wildcat? is dili=
gently sought-after for its long lasting  blooms.   Our Antiqued  Holiday W=
reath  is a preserved design whose color scheme works  with most decors. It=
 is available with our brass wreath hanger,  making it a breeze to display.=
 And don?t forget the ideal  autumn birthday gift! The Golden  Harvest Rose=
s  bouquet is sure to add special meaning to a  wonderful occasion.  Rememb=
er to visit Autumn  Sales  where you will find keen gifts like the Autumn  =
Jewel Arch  at very special prices!  Calyx  & Corolla   =09[IMAGE]=09
