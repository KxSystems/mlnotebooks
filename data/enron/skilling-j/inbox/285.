I wanted to thank each of you for participating in the venture group's "Grand Slam" event this week.  It was a big success.  We received very positive feedback from the attendees.  One of our primary objectives was to provide our portfolio companies with further insight into EBS' strategy/business model, and each of your presentations was a key part of telling the Enron/EBS story.  In order for the portfolio companies to develop products that are strategic to EBS, it is imperative that they fully understand our business model.  I know everybody's schedule is very busy, so we appreciate you taking the time.

Regards,
Patrick
