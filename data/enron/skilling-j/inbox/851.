From 4:00 - 8:00 p.m., Trizechan Properties has scheduled a shutdown of all electrical service at 3 Allen Center.  Enron Network Services will power down the 3AC network infrastructure between 3:30-4:00.  There will be no 3 Allen Center network access during the electrical maintenance and the outage will continue until ENS is able to power up all of the networking devices.  
All 3AC and 2AC employees will have no telephone or voicemail service during outage period. When power is restored to building, systems will be powered back up and telco services tested for dial tone and connectivity.
If you need access to 3AC anytime that Saturday, you will need to contact Trizechan Properties beforehand with your security information (Jael Olson at 713-336-2300).  Anyone who attempts to enter the building on Saturday that is not on the list will be denied access.
