Do I see another re-enactment of the (in)famous eWooglin dorg?  Maybe an all
new version of the "weakest link" (aka The Shep)in the making for prime time
TV.  Like Bro Storhtz I will be thinking of you home comers (does this make
you homies?), just not from Palm Springs - Howard Cunningham and I will be
attending an ACE Hardware convention in beautiful KC!  Speaking of Storhtz,
I received an e-mail from him recently.  He thinks we were on opposite ends
of the political spectrum while at SMU.  Can you believe that shit?
Whatever.....
This web site stuff is great.  I have been "listening" to all this banter.
It takes me back to days of youth.......and my Beta days.  My daughter is a
first year student (I hope she still is - that is where I send the checks)
at SMU & Wheeler & I have seen Drow, Grumps, Mule and some others recently
on our trips to Dallas.
Hope everyone has a great homecoming - wish Wheeler & I could be there.  We
have a special invitation for all Betas.  Our company will be having our
annual Christmas party on December 8th in Okemah, and we are inviting you.
Now, before you hurt yourself laughing, check out the band; Red Dirt
Rangers.  This party will rival the Studio Club and Texas Rose!  Check out
their web site www.reddirtrangers.com.  Lodging is available for all comers
We hope you can make it.
