Mr. Skilling,  
Hello! My name is Tim Ng and I was a summer analyst the last 2 summers. Last  
August, I met with you for a few minutes in your office to talk and ask for  
advice. You told me to diversify my life experiences, as that can only help  
you throughout life. Like you, with your desire to fly planes, I decided to  
take a plane to travel around the world. In the last year, I studied abroad  
in Hong Kong, traveled to places such as China, Macau, Thailand, and  
Australia. After travelling, I see how doing different things, seeing  
different things can only enhance your total life experience.  
Tomorrow, I will return to Enron as a full-time Analyst. I look forward to  
this opportunity to learn more, and challenge myself, and hopefully, do new  
and different things to diversify my experiences.  
I thank you for taking the time to meet with me last summer. It really meant  
a lot to me, and your advice has really changed the way I go about things in  
life now.  
Perhaps one day, I can meet with you again. I know that your schedule can  
only be busier now, but hopefully I can see you during your talk with the new  
Analysts sometime in the next week or so.  
Take care and I hope to hear from you soon!  
Kindest regards,  
Tim Ng
