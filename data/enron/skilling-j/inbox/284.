  Issue for: June 2001       Is Your Company Ready to go Mobile?   Informat=
ion Anytime, Anywhere.  Mobile devices enable an organization to take its t=
raditional computing infrastructure and existing data, and extend it to the=
 furthest reaches of its business.  Your company can place the information =
and services  in the hands of those making critical business decisions and =
serving customers any time, anywhere.   No matter where someone works, mobi=
le devices enable them to access the information and services they need to =
get their job done faster with higher quality.   Some of the types of appli=
cations deployed on Handheld PCs are:  Inventory Management  Sales Force Au=
tomation  Customer Service  Financial Services  Healthcare/Medical   Visit =

n and Services to the Houston SPCA   ESX just launched a new web site devel=
oped for the Houston Society  for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA). =
 ESX, as a donation to support the non-profit organization, provided an ent=
irely new site including creative design and the technology platform used f=
or content management.   ESX developed the new site using our Community Cat=
alyst Platform (Catalyst), a content management tool.  Using the Catalyst, =
the SPCA will be able to  delegate control over sections of the site to vol=
unteers, who will then be able to easily update the content using a web bro=
wser.        Take a look at the new Houston SPCA web Site.      Updating Ex=
isting Software  Upgrading from DOS to Windows, or Web Enabling    Deciding=
 to migrate existing software applications to a new platform is a big decis=
ion.  However, a lot of benefits are gained from doing it. A web interface =
can give legacy applications a modern graphical interface, deliver them to =
employees' desktops  regardless of platform, and grant secure access to dis=
tributed databases across the enterprise. Portions of the programs can be e=
xposed over the Internet, allowing  high-value self-service transactions. T=
his lowers the required number of customer service personnel, and adds a ne=
w dimension to the way customers and vendors can  interact with your busine=
ss. Elements of your existing software can often be re-used as the foundati=
on for the upgraded solution.      Vis it  our web site today to find out h=
ow we can help you map your migration path.         =09
