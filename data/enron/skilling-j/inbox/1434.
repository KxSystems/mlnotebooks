Jeff,
I was very sorry to read about your decision to leave Enron.  I expected you to be a great CEO and the ideal person to lead Enron into the future.  I'm very sorry that personal circumstances led to a change of course for you.
Please keep me informed about your plans as they develop.  If I can be of help, please don't hesitate to let me know.

All the best,

Bob Zoellick
