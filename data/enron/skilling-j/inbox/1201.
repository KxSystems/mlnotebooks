Prior to his nomination by President Clinton as U.S. Ambassador to Israel, Ambassador Djerejian served both President Bush and President Clinton as Asst. Sec. of State for Near Eastern Affairs and President Reagan and President Bush as U.S. Ambassador to the Syrian Arab Republic.  He served in the United States Army as a First Lieutenant in the Republic of Korea following his graduation from the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University and holds both a BS and an Honorary Doctorate from Georgetown University and is fluent in Arabic, Russian, French and Armenian.
Ambassador Djerejian has been awarded the Presidential Distinguished Service Award, the Department of State's Distinguished Honor Award, the President's Meritorious Service Award and the Ellis Island Medal of Honor.
