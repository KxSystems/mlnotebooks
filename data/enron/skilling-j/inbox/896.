Ok Drow,
BO&BM
You will note that I haven't responded to all the Beta replies cause I
didn't need to talk to bros.  They needed to talk to each other ( I shoulda
been a counselor).
My whiny ass plea was a service response to another brother, who loves you
very much BTW,  and will go unnamed (to avoid your venomous attacks).  He
thought that perhaps eWooglin was busted and we were running a test.

The test worked.  The bros are talking again.
Including you, you big shit, so cut me some slack.

But if you're feeling lonely and blue.... just reach out and send email.
Or come down to Austin and we'll cuddle.

Shacklepuss,
    I made the grave error of not checking my email for the past three days
and then pull it up only to find about 4,000 Beta replies to your whiny ass
plea for somebody to talk to.  My theory is you were just feeling very
lonely and blue, and missed some serious homosexual overtures from the
bros.
  Well, it worked.....will have to remember that the next time I'm feeling
lonely and blue.

Yours in -kai-,
Drow

PS. Chuckles, can't BELIEVE you actually put your brother's address and
phone number on the website.  If any of these gorillas actually show up and
scratch one of his precious autos or spray paint one of his fricking Van
Gogh's,  he'll just shit!!

At Homecoming 2000, the BETA TENT had the biggest crowd by far.  Stay
connected and consider a future homecoming BETA reunion.  It's
incredible...forget the 20 years in between...everyone just seems to pick
it up right where they left off years ago.
