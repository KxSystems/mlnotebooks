=09=09=09 The market soared on the wings of Icarus today? the European Cent=
ral Banks cut their interest rates after we cut ours earlier this week. Wee=
kly initial jobless claims were down 46,000, and retail sales were up 2.3%.=
 The Dow was up 167, the NASDAQ up 51, and the S&P up 20?The market flew to=
 high to fast and burnt its wing on the sun?The minutes were released from =
the FOMC showing the 50 point basis cut was a unanimous decision and laying=
 the Fed's uncertainty bare. Profit-takers swooped in and the market fell b=
ack to earth with the Nasdaq down 9.76 points or 0.53% at 1827.77, the Dow =
closing up 33.08 points or 0.35% at 9587.45, and the S&P up 2.73 points or =
0.25% at 1118.53. Tech's winners today were AOL (AOL Time Warner) up 5.7%; =
SUNW (Sun Micro) up 5.4%; MU (Micron) up 3.9%, otherwise it was all no chan=
ge or red change: Semi Capital: AMAT* (Applied Materials) down 2.4%; KLAC (=
KLA-Tencor) down 3.5%; NVLS* (Novellus) down 1.8%; IBM and DELL didn't go v=
ery far but HWP (Hewlett Packard) down 4.3%; AAPL (Apple) down 4.5%; GTW (G=

ear Ago - 11/7/00     40 Years ago today Kennedy narrowly beat Nixon.... wh=
ile I write the current Gore/Bush outcome is still not certain... it all co=
mes down to Florida - home of Disney World and "Old Sparky" (the nick-name =
for the state's electric chair which recently set one prisoners head on fir=
e during his execution) - culturally this state is a potpourri - the Northe=
rn section is Southern (among it cultural contributions - the rock group Ly=
nard Skynard) and the Sourthern section probable has more New Yorkers than =
Albany and as many Cubans as Havanna.... W's brother is the Governor but re=
member he lost the first time around.  Yesterday I quipped that a Gore vict=
ory by the electoral college but not the popular vote would be bad for Wall=
 Street and Main Street.  My focus was the disparity between the outcomes. =
 If Bush wins in the same fashion (not the popular mandate) - it will also =
be problem.  This hasn't happened since the 19 century when notions of popu=
lar sovereignty were different - a vast majority of today's citizens would =
have been legally excluded. A vote for the President is the only one shared=
 by all Americans. It is a personal matter - explanations of victory based =
on understanding the 18 century origins of the electoral college, won't was=
h.   A candidate who wins the election with a minority of votes seems antit=
hetical to someone regarded by many people as "the leader of the free world=
".       The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 closed where they opened.... was this a=
 political statement? To quote Lou Reed: "I guess I just don't know and I g=
uess I just don't know".  Some big names took a breather today (moving less=
 than 1%): WMT (Walmart) HD (Home Depot) SUNW (Sun) PEP (Pepsi) KO (Coke) I=
NTC (Intel) C (Citigroup) MMM (Minnesota Mining and Mineral) DIS (Disney) J=
NJ (Johnson & Johnson) and UPS. The Dow mimicked the sentiment by going up =
nearly 20 and down over 50 before ending off 25.... In IPOland - Transmeta =
- TMTA - was pure TNT - up 115% - haven't seen those kinda #s since dot.com=
 days of yore - they make a special chip that uses less power.      -Bram T=
