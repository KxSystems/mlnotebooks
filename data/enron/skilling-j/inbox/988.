[IMAGE]=09 [IMAGE]     Dear Jeffrey Skilling,   The finer things in life ar=
e sometimes green. Our modestly monochromatic  Fragrant  Eucalyptus Bouquet=
  (shown right) is a natural display of greenery  that shows true luxury ha=
s nothing to do with imposing grandeur.  Easy to arrange in our architectur=
al glass vase, the bouquet can  be left to air-dry naturally for enjoyment =
indefinitely in the  home or workplace, and has a unique fresh scent.   Wit=
h its handcrafted, grass-covered pot, our Grass  and Grain Sculpture  is an=
 unusual dried arrangement in a natural  palette of beiges and pale gray-gr=
eens. Perfectly suited for any  type of gift giving, it is an interesting w=
ay to add natural beauty  to a setting and best of all, it requires no care=
.  As the weather changes, you can surely add warmth to a special  occasion=
 with our decisively different Strawflower Plant . Also known as Everlastin=
g Flower or Paper  Daisy, our cheerful Strawflower plant will bloom for mon=
ths. The  papery petals actually make a rustling sound as the flowers open!=
  Two eclectic fall specials we are proud to showcase this October  are our=
 Obake Anthuriums  and our majestic Protea   that create a much-admired tro=
pical look.   Please remember National Boss?s Day is Tuesday, October  16. =
We invite you to visit our Specials   page for ideal gift selections & our =
Sale   page for limited-time offers.  Calyx  & Corolla   =09[IMAGE]=09
