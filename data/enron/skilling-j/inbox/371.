If you guys watched the Monaco Grand Prix this past Sunday...  perhaps you saw the fellow from the Ferrari team who went on the podium to  receive the winner's trophy from Prince Ranier?
 
That was my good friend Luca Baldisserri, who is the chief  engineer for Ferrari and won almost everything these past few years with his  driver Michael Schumacher...Luca is likely the best car engineer in the world,  and is interested to join me in the future as a partner to operate a team in the  U.S. based CART "IndyCar" series...
 
I invited you both as our sport requires strong corporate  partners to function... and thought you may have interest with knowledge that  you would be working with some of the best people in the world... which would  make it reasonable to achieve a very positive return on any corporate  investment.
 
Please feel welcome to keep in touch... and to join us  for a race this summer if you wish.
 
Best to you
Eric Jensen
