Dear Jeff,
 
Congratulations on your recent promotions at  Enron.  My name is J.P. Monteverde III.  We met several years ago, I  am from Pittsburgh and moved here in 1987.  I recently started a company  called MyGiveBack, Inc.  The company is unique in that it generates money  for charitable causes on a regular basis.  Attached please find a copy of  our business overview.
 
I would like the opportunity to meet with you to  discuss the synergy between MyGiveBack and Enron.  I know you are very  busy.  I am only asking for ten minutes of your time.  (Give me ten  minutes and I will give you a round of golf at Oakmont Country Club the next  time you visit Pittsburgh)!!!
 
Thank you in advance for your consideration.   Have a great weekend!
 
All the best,
 
J.P. Monteverde III
