alDentiii, JaDrow:

I applaud your additions and input!  He's right, Woody.
And he doesn't need me to say that, either, but I wish I had thought of what he added first!

The B.F. (Black Fraternity, what are the Greek letters?) holds most of the cards in this scenario.  Therefore, whoever the intermediary is is excruciatingly important vis-a-vis credibility with local Auburn parties as well as the National fraternities.

Bottom line:  Can everybody (including the polka-dotted people) step outside of their stereotypical roles for a minute and make a statement to their unborn sons and daughters that racism of all colors ends with our generation?  (Shocking coming from a Republican)  Or is this just another news story, another missed opportunity?  After all, we went to SMU for the same reason they are at Auburn now.  Most of us are or will be amused to look back at some of the unexpected sources of the lessons learned.

Can you tell that my profession is very close to this question more often than all of its members wish to admit?

The Less Diplomatic Brother Sarl

At Homecoming 2000, the BETA TENT had the biggest crowd by far.  Stay connected and consider a future homecoming BETA reunion.  It's incredible...forget the 20 years in between...everyone just seems to pick it up right where they left off years ago.
