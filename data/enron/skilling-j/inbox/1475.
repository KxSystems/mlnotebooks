Mr. Skilling,

I realize this message may seem quite unexpected, but
I could not resist.  It's been a long time since I
knew you at FoxFire Cabins.  Since then I have
completed my undergraduate degree at Trinity
University and recently my MBA at the University of
Texas San Antonio.  In my current job search for a
marketing career, I found a marketing position open at
Enron and applied for it.  As I researched the
company, one that I have watched in the past because
of your connection, I saw that you are now President
and CEO.  Your success is quite remarkable.
I just wanted to re-introduce myself to you as an
adult and recent graduate and hope that somewhere in
the future there may be an opportunity to work at
Enron.  Also, as a very successful MBA yourself, I
welcome any advice you may provide a newcomer to the
business world.  Hope you are doing well with all your
endeavors.

Sincerely,
Leslye Kellner
