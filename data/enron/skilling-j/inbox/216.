Dear Jeffrey,

I am contacting you at the suggestion of my brother Jeff Spar, Chief
Information Officer of Reader's Digest and formerly of McKinsey [NYO 1990-
1999].

I am the CEO of a Houston based Microsoft technology consultancy
called ESX Engineering. ESX has strong capabilities in software
development, IT infrastructure and creative services. We have exceptional
capability in Mobile/Wireless and Web based workflow application
development. We also have tremendous domain experience in healthcare
solutions.

As a small company CEO I am always looking for new opportunities to meet
individuals whose firms may have need of our services. I would appreciate
the opportunity to meet and introduce myself and ESX. If appropriate we
could explore any potential opportunities between your firm and ESX, or
perhaps you could provide a further referral.

Sincerely Yours,

Steve Spar


PS - ESX was recently featured in the Growth Strategies section of the
Houston Business Journal.  You can view the article on the HBJ site
