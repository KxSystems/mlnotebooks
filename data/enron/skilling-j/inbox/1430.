Brothers,
 
EWooglin has been taking a nap.  Some time ago Yahoo acquired E-Group,  where our SMU Beta Theta Pi group site was located.  Be sure to update your  e-mail address book with the new address to use to reach all the members with  one easy e-mail:
 smu-betas@yahoogroups.com 
 
If you want to check out the site...have your ID name and password handy  and sign in at:
 http://groups.yahoo.com/ 
 
Apparently, our pictures didn't make the transition to Yahoo.  Feel  free to start rebuilding our album in your spare time.
