Today's LA Times editorial  revived the Lockyer quote.  It is remarkable (a=
nd troubling for Enron)  that Lockyer's political peers / rivals have not t=
aken  him to task for his outrageous remark; nor have the major  newspapers=
.  In Today's editorial, the usually conservative LA Times  refers to Locky=
er as having "boosted the rhetoric a notch."  (I'd hate  to witness two or =
three notches.)

This lack of  criticism could foreshadow a contagious attitude that powerfu=
l Enron is in  fact the one to blame (facts be damned).  Given Enron's high=
 profile policy  and fundraising ties to the Bush administration and Govern=
or Gray  Davis' war with President Bush and Texas energy companies, there c=
ould be  more turbulence ahead.  Fasten your seatbelts and be on the  ready=
.

] [IMAGE]  Energy Antics: Oh, Behave!          Admit it: The only  comic re=
lief in this energy crisis has been watching our leaders go at  suppliers a=
nd each other like pro wrestlers or Jerry Springer guests.        In his St=
ate of the State address last  January, Gov. Gray Davis accused the big pri=
vate electric power generators  of legalized highway robbery and threatened=
 to seize their plants if  necessary. Then he really got angry, calling the=
m "the biggest snakes in  the world." This past week, Atty. Gen. Bill Locky=
er boosted the rhetoric a  notch by declaring he would like to personally e=
scort the chairman of  Enron Corp. "to an 8-by-10 cell that he could share =
with a tattooed dude  who says, 'Hi, my name is Spike, honey."' Meanwhile, =
President Bush and  Vice President Dick Cheney have blamed California for c=
ausing its own  problems with a "harebrained" deregulation scheme and mocke=
d the state's  power purchases and conservation programs. It's been fun. No=
w it's time  for our leaders to act like adults.        Davis and Bush alwa=
ys will have their  political differences, but the economies of both the st=
ate and the nation  are endangered by California's energy situation. These =
leaders need to  work together as cooperatively as possible, starting next =
week when Bush  makes his first visit to California as president.        Da=
vis wrote Bush Wednesday offering to  meet with him during his California v=
isit. Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer  said the president looks forward to dis=
cussing energy and other issues.  Good start. Let's hope the conversation i=
s civil and that the civility  spreads.       No matter how much California=
  has been abused by the power companies, and it absolutely has, the state =
 still needs them to help solve the crisis caused by shortages of electric =
 power generation this year and next. Usually, the biggest targets of  offi=
cial and public wrath are the investor-owned utilities such as  Southern Ca=
lifornia Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric Co. But not this  time because, =
in the view of the state, the utilities have been bled dry  by the power ge=
nerators' stratospheric prices. The state had to take over  the purchase of=
 power when the generators refused to extend any more  credit to Edison and=
 PG&E. Legal recourse should be pursued, but the  threatening rhetoric need=
s to subside.        State lawmakers are right to be upset  with the White =
House for refusing to use its authority to set reasonable  temporary wholes=
ale price controls. And Davis is justifiably upset with  Bush and with Chen=
ey, who said the only solution was to build more power  plants--ignoring th=
e fact that the state is building 10 plants now, with  five more on the way=
, and that the only way to control wholesale power  rates is for Washington=
 to cap them.       If  the state hadn't bought the power, the generators w=
ould have let the  lights go out. Davis needs to deliver that message, quie=
tly and  persuasively, while Bush is in California. And Bush needs to liste=
n  respectfully, like an adult.   [IMAGE]Search the archives  of the Los  A=
