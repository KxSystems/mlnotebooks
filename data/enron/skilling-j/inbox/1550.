Dear Bros.,
    I'm happy to announce Grumps came through his angioplasty procedure
today with flying colors.  The artery in question was, in fact, 100% blocked
and they successfully unblocked it with the balloon.  Bro's Benson, Walker
and I were there to lend moral support to Linda, as was Grump's Pastor and
Associate Pastor.  Always thought God and Wooglin made for a fairly
formidable duo.
     Grumps was a different man after so many of you called and expressed
your concern, support and love.  He was indeed very much afraid, as would be
anybody, but your thoughts and well-wishes provided immeaurable morale
building at a time when he most needed it.
     Thanks again guys.  He'll be playing golf within a week.

Yours in -kai-,
Drow
