Thanks for the update on Grumbles. I'm heading south to Iola on Sunday to  
visit with John. If anybody wants to join me, I'd enjoy the company. Let me

 At Homecoming 2000, the BETA TENT had the biggest crowd by far.  Stay connected and consider a future homecoming BETA reunion.  It's incredible...forget the 20 years in between...everyone just seems to pick it up right where they left off years ago.
