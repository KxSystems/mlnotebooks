Hi Mr. Skilling,
I am hoping that you can direct me to the correct  person to vet a sponsors=
hip opportunity to the LatinSummit. The LatinSummit is a  unique forum for =
Enron to gain invaluable exposure at the same time as the World  Bank & IMF=
 Annual Meetings. Below and attached is information on the  upcoming event.=
  Please consider this opportunity and I look forward to  hearing from you.
Sincerely,
James Ontra

=09=09=09 The Premier Conference on  Investing in the Americas Presented du=
ring the 2001 Annual  Meeting of the World Bank Group and  the Internationa=
l Monetary  Fund October 1-3, 2001 Omni Shoreham Hotel - Washington  D.C.  =
 International  Venture Partners, LLC is pleased and excited to announce ou=
r  upcoming Latin American Investment Summit (LatinSummit), the premier  co=
nference on investing in the Americas, presented during the Annual  Meeting=
 of the World Bank Group and the International Monetary Fund.   The LatinSu=
mmit is a unique opportunity for your  company to connect with top business=
 executives, government officials and  other potential customers at the lar=
gest and most important annual  gathering of world leaders from the public =
and private sectors. Adjacent  to the LatinSummit will be the ExpoAmericas,=
 consisting of a  maximum of fifty exhibitors, including some of the most p=
rominent  international companies working in Latin America.   Why should yo=
ur company be a Sponsor?  The Annual Meeting attracts over 15,000  particip=
ants, including presidents, ministers, other senior  government officials, =
as well as thousands of senior level executives  from the private sector.  =
 The Annual Meting attracts extensive international  press coverage and is =
televised throughout the world. Full media  coverage.  Three-day Conference=
 with top-level speakers  from the public and private sector. LatinSummit w=
ill explore the  unique challenges of financing public and private sector p=
rojects in  Latin America with a focus on infrastructure finance, capital m=
arkets,  commercial lending, mergers and acquisitions and private equity  i=
nvesting.   Very exclusive ExpoAmericas, with no more than  50 exhibitors a=
nd open admission to all Annual Meeting and  LatinSummit attendees. Your co=
mpany will have maximum  exposure.     LatinSummit will be held in the same=
 venue as the  Annual Meetings of the World Bank and the International Mone=
tary Fund,  providing ideal networking opportunities.  Because LatinSummit =
is organized by IVP (www.ivp-ny.com), an investment banking firm  focused o=
n Latin America, and not a conference organizer, we will ensure  that the a=
genda covers only the most poignant topics.  Presented by the organizers of=
 Cyber Americas (www.cyber-americas.com) at the Inter-American  Development=
 Bank's Annual Meeting in March 2001. Past sponsors include  PriceWaterhous=
eCoopers, Oracle, American Airlines, Optiglobe, Lucent  Technologies, Accen=
ture, Impsat, America Online, Global Crossing,  Greenberg Traurig, Bloomber=
g, Exodus Communications and others. Our  experience will ensure an extreme=
ly successful  event.  We are offering a variety of sponsorship opportuniti=
es  from which to choose from. We hope that you will join us for this uniqu=
e  event.  Feel free to contact me at your convenience. =09
