Build-to-order, modularity, open architectures, the 72-hour car, and the 1-month global car design are all on the horizon.  What are the information technologies that will enable these concepts?  How will legacy systems be incorporated?  What will be the evolving issues surrounding security?  How will the Internet and wireless communication technologies be used to insure adequate data mobility?  What will be the impact of information systems on supply chain management?  How will collaborative work systems for the professional evolve as new information technologies and new automotive concepts emerge?
