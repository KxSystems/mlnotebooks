Mr. Awano,

Per your recent request to Dr. Kitatani, we have contacted Mr. Idei's Office to
find out his travel plans to the US in June.  Unfortunately, we were informed
that he is currently not scheduled to be out in the West Coast in June, and
therefore, will not be able to meet with Mr. Skilling at this time.

However, we were also informed by Mr. Idei's Office that he would be more than
happy to meet with Mr. Skilling during his next visit to Tokyo.  Therefore,
please keep us posted on any future travel plans to Tokyo that Mr. Skilling may
have so that we may assist you accordingly.

Thank you and should you have any questions, please don't hesitate to call.

Best regards,

Ann Rubin
