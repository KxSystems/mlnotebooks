Dear Messer's Skilling and Lay,

I heard a song with the lyrics "how can I say thanks for all the things you=
've done for me", I'm pretty sure it's by Andre Crouch.  Let me thank you f=
or the help and loving kindness you and ENRON has shown to me during the pe=
riod after the devasting floods.  I've never worked for such a wonderful co=
mpany before, the people here in every walk of life are so very friendly.  =
The scriptures speaks of drawing people toward you with loving kindness, an=
d you certainly have here at ENRON.  The people that i've met here want to =
be here and that's a good sign.  One morning on the elevator a lady was sin=
ging on the way to her floor, i didn't recognize the tune right away, proba=
bly because it was early morning, the tune turned out to be "OKLAHOMA" so I=
 joined her, she invited me to come and be a part of the ENRON CHOIR.  Just=
  the other day you Mr. Skilling passed my desk and asked had my group just=
 moved to the 31st floor, i've only been here at ENRON since January '01 an=
d wasn't aware that my group had moved from the 29th floor.  My Grandmother=
 always used to tell me as a child, "you better keep a thought in mind, tha=
t someones watching you, and they want to be just like you, setting their e=
xamples by you, and they're never gonna miss a single thing you do.  And I =
live by that today.  Well I can be a little longwinded,  but remember:

If I can help somebody  as I pass along,
If I can cheer somebody with a word or song,
If I can can show somebody that he's traveling wrong,
Then my living shall not be in vain.

And you both have certainly obeyed that dictum.


God Bless You Both,
