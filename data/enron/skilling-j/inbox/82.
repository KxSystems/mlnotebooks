financial derivatives. Today's search for trading liquidity will
restructure the industry into three markets: liquidity hubs, merchant
platforms, and solution sites.

topic in detail at "New Directions For Online Energy Trading," a
complimentary Executive Breakfast. The Event will be held at the St.

on these questions:
