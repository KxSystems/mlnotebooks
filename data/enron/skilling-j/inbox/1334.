Gentlemen:

We have had to slightly change the forum retreat meeting with Bill Evans
to the following:

		Wednesday 10/24	Start meeting at 12 PM (noon) through
5:00 pm
		Thursday 10/25		Start meeting at 8:00 AM through
5:00 pm
		Friday 10/26		Start meeting at 8:00 AM and end
at 12:00 pm (noon)

We had originally scheduled to meet all day Wednesday and all Thursday.
Paul Murphy has a board meeting on Wednesday morning and could not make
it until after lunch.  We decided to start the meeting on Wednesday at
noon (with lunch) and end on Friday at noon.

We have booked hotel rooms at The Houstonian for 2 nights (Wednesday and
Thursday).

Please advise by email if this will work with your schedules.  Thank you
for your assistance in this matter.
