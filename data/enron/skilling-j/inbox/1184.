Hello Jeff-- I had been meaning to contact you recently but events somewhat curbed that idea. Wanted to know a couple things, first if we can continue to sent you The Desk, and second if you'd be intersted in participating on our editorial board. Not a lot of responsibility really, but, more of an on-call advisor on market or ops issues -- other members often submit commentaries for The Desk or The Risk Desk, Bandwidth Desk etc, on market issues and so on. Also, if you're on the board, we'll send you the publications for free -- anyhow, let me know. Interested to learn what your plans are--understand the pressure you publicly described from running the big E, but, all of us here and others in the market firmly believe this game would suffer a huge loss were that "Skilling fellow" to call energy markets "quits" for good. If there is anything we can do, let me know. Also attached the special edition we ran last week, in the wake of the NYC tragedy. 
Best,
John Sodergreen
