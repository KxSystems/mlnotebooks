Don of the Dels, 
You had  better put on your fire resistant suit, Del, as I think it is still 
on  fire!  I think one of the boys left a fat one smoking up there.   Maybe 
Drow could drop trow over the burning roof and let go with a  flutter blast or 
a three point freep and put out the blaze. Lord  Windasmere to the rescue!  Oh 
he shits!  The champion is  disqualified! 
See you in Norman on the 24th.  Tell Joe Don Looney  to be there, in drag or 
normal clothes.  OU Sooners...13 in a row and  only 35 more to go to break the 
record and give Dent a reason to write  another book!
