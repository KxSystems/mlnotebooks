Hess, 
Thanks for your words of encouragement. I knew Gary Vale from a distance and feel sorrow for his death. I am confident in saying that all of us have a Gary Vale in our lives. It may be a family member, close friend or a colleague at work. You're not alone in second guessing yourself. I have asked myself several times, what if I only extended a Christian hand and tried to help this person, I could have possibly made a difference in the outcome. As I have slowly learned since my college days, your either a Minister for Christ or your need one. That role can of course reverse on any given day. 
Sorry you can't make it to BIG D for Homecoming, but your not missing much since the 76ers are whimmping out. How pathetic.

 At Homecoming 2000, the BETA TENT had the biggest crowd by far.  Stay connected and consider a future homecoming BETA reunion.  It's incredible...forget the 20 years in between...everyone just seems to pick it up right where they left off years ago.
