Brothers George and Justin,
 Welcome to the Beta e-Wooglin group.Or as most people here in Houston say,
"Bienvenidos".I was the former scholarship chairman of the Gamma Omega
chapter in'72-'73.My main contribution to the chapter was to initiate the
comparison of the semester grade point averages of the pot smokers vs. the
drinkers. There was a  spirited competition and a much awaited, well
attended Monday night meeting when the winning team was announced. It was
always close.We remain a pretty tolerant bunch as we reach our late 40's and
early 50's. The parts of my college life that I remember were excellent.
This is a fun bunch of guys and I enjoy keeping up with them.
-kai- from #487
