[IMAGE]=09 [IMAGE]     Dear Jeff Skilling,   Now that fall is finally here,=
 it is time to showcase  the season?s brilliant color. Decorators in the kn=
ow accentuate  this changing season with the high-energy hues of gold, burg=
undy,  orange and yellow. Calyx & Corolla has taken their cue. We  offer a =
divine medley of colorful bouquets, preserved designs  and even bulb kits p=
aying tribute to fall.   Our Williamsburg  Bouquet  (shown right) is a stun=
ning assortment of terra cotta  colored roses, golden Peruvian lilies, russ=
et hypericum berries  and unusual velvety orange coxcomb. It truly recreate=
s the look  of the pedigreed blooms found in the historical manor homes of =
 Virginia. The exceptional crackle-finish footed urn in which it  is displa=
yed is adapted from those in the European market circa  1800.    Our sweet =
Rose  Spice Wreath  brings a concentration of fall color to a small  area w=
hile our Golden  Harvest Roses  proclaim the season in a riotous display. C=
ombining  ruffled yellow roses with flaming orange roses it's a wonderful  =
choice for any occasion   We're pleased to introduce our new Ranunculus  Bu=
lb Kit . This sophisticated flower is well known for its  dense, round head=
s of distinctive crepe paper-like petals and  has been noted by many trend =
watchers for its growing popularity.  Our kit is a unique take on these blo=
oms and makes a perfect gift,  especially for those with children.   We inv=
ite you to visit our Sale page for limited-time offers  & our Birthdays   p=
age for darling gift-giving ideas.    Calyx  & Corolla   =09[IMAGE]=09
