Jeff, I was sorry to read of your resignation from Enron. I believe your
leadership and vision have put the Company on a path that will serve it well
for many years into the future.I always remember fondly the years we spent
plotting strategies for the "new world" of the natural gas industry. Best of
luck in your future endevors. If you are ever in Denver, please give me a
call (303-783-0857). Don
