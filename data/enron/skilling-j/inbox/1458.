I just wanted to say thanks for coming by and speaking with the IPG visitors last week, and spending so much time with them.  Your comments combined with the rest of the tour left them  with just the impression we wanted to give them. They are eager to see if a deal can be struck between our two companies so we will begin finalizing a term sheet as soon as possible. 
 
I would have sent the thank you note earlier, but at the end of the day I took my family on vacation to my parents place.  There I had a chance to run into Bart Robinson one of your former co-workers from the consulting days, and one of my parents good friends.  He says hello.  Thanks again and I still remain impressed how commercial the senior management at Enron is compared to Coastal/Engage where I came from.
