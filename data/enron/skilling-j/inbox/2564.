Many of you have asked to send an email when we launch.

I am pleased to let you know that ZapMedia officially launched its flagship
product, the  ZapStation - a multimedia CD/DVD  player and digital
music/movie jukebox, with unlimited Internet access and up-to-date news from
the USATODAY - a precedent in the rapidly growing digital home entertainment
space.

Below is an ad that appeared in the 11/14/01 Sports Section of the USATODAY,
courtesy of our partners at Gannett.  You can also get more details at
www.zapmedia.com.

Regards,

Eric
