Hello, Sherri!    I just wanted to let you know that Stan is out of the
office today on a field trip, but I will discuss this with him on Monday.

I know how incredibly busy you all are, so I'm sure that making a pledge to
Jeff for the MS150 has simply slipped your mind.  Well the ride is this
weekend, time is running out and we need you!

Enron's goal is to raise $700,000, and Jeff's personal goal is to raise
$50,000.  As of today, we are a little better than half way there.  Won't
you consider helping him reach his goal?

Thanks for your consideration.  I look forward to hearing from you
tomorrow...

Sherri :-)
