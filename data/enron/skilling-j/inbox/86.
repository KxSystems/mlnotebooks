It would be a HUGE help if a car could meet me at the Four Seasons (1300
Lamar Street) about 7:15.  Just let me know, otherwise I will take a cab.

Where should we meet with Jeff tomorrow at 8:15??

Kevin

Kevin, I got your message about not being available for dinner -  no
problem.  The other panelists were arriving too late also, so the dinner
was cancelled.

I just wanted to touch base and make sure you had everything thing you need
for tomorrow morning.  I'm attaching a map to the North Shepherd facility;
it's about 10 minutes outside of downtown.  I would be happy to make
arrangements for a sedan to pick you up if you like; just let me know from
where.

The event begins with a buffet breakfast at 7:30 a.m. and your panel will
begin at 8:45 a.m.  Jeff would like to meet with you, David Arnoff  and
John Thornton around 8:15 a.m. to cover any last minute items about the
panel.
I'll be at the North Shepherd facility beginning about 2:00 p.m. CDT today,
so you can reach me on my cell phone (713.854.1426).  Do not hesitate to
call me should you have any questions or need additional information as I
will not have access to e-mail after 2:00 p.m.

Regards, SRS
