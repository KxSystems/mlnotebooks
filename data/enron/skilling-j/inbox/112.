"If everybody is thinking alike, then somebody isn't thinking."  - George S. Patton, Jr.
 
Keeping with our Mind's Eye Madness week, be sure to check out the Enron Mind's Eye Motorcade 
on Friday, April 27th from 11:30am to 1:00pm at the Big E Cafe.  This art car convoy will spend the day visiting 
Enron-designated stops in the community to promote innovation and creativity.  Mirroring Enron's innovation, 
these artists think about the way things could be and are not limited by the way things are.

Featuring:
Lunch by Escalantes Mexican Grille - choice of beef, chicken or veggie fajitas with trimmings, dessert and a drink for $5.  
Live salsa music will be provided by Tropicrew, featuring Enron's own Ms. Alex Villarreal as the lead singer.  
Non-profit organizations represented will include the March of Dimes, SEARCH and the Lupus Foundation of America.  
Get lunch free if you're dressed "freaky"!
