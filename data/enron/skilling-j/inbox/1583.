Jeff:

Congratulations on the work you have been doing at Enron.  It must be an
exciting time for you and I enjoy watching the company grow under your
direction.  On a different note, my firm has continued to expand it's
business practices.  We have been working with companies like Shell, Texaco,
Coca-Cola, Dell Computer, Bristol-Myers Squibb and others.  I would very
much appreciate having the opportunity to meet with your head of human
resources (or anyone you feel appropriate) to present our capabilities.  Any
assistance you could provide in this area would certainly be appreciated.

Thanks again and look forward to staying in touch.
