Attn:Jeffrey
RE:INVITATION TO TRANSACT A BUSINESS
I feel the less compunction in intruding to your kind
heartedness; I have been noted about your reputable
existence and I consequently reposed in you the most
esteemed confidence, it is with trust and
uncompromising faith that I humbly herein to disclose
this personal confidential issue to you.
I am a management consultants based  in the Republic
of the Gambia representing businessmen in the western
coast of Africa with extensive clientele.
Note,the current  president of the Gambia, (President
Yaya .A.Jammeh) is a close friend of mine.
Due to the on-going presidential election in the
country and focus on the strong pressure given to him
by his opposition, he requested that I should  assist
in sourcing for a reliable individual/company anywhere
in the world in order to transact the sum of
($19.6Million USDollars) which is in his possession.
He has of course decided to make good use of the fund
because he don't know if he will win the election or
not.Please kindly help us out of this impasse, and I
sincerely hope you will not deny us this wish.
Note,there is practically no risk involved in this
issue, healthy arrangment have been made before I
contacted you.
I f you need  any question,do not hesitate to ask. I
will be very grateful to hear from you as urgently as
you can.
Yours Sincerely
Prince Johnson Zakii
PRINCE-CONSULTANTS-INC.
