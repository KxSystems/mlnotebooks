I am sure that you have forwarded this email to a more senior Michael Brown, however, I would be glad to pledge to Jeff's ride this weekend.  You see, last fall my daughter died of Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), she was nine months old and if they find a cure for MS, the cure for SMA will not be far behind as they are simular deseases.

So I would like to pledge $500 towards the ride in honor of my daughter, Hayden.  All I ask is that when the ride gets really hard, to think of her & all the others like her that will benefit from this ride, then peddle little harder.

You can send someone to pick up my check as I am located @ EB 3108F.

Sincerely,
Michael L. Brown

I know how incredibly busy you all are, so I'm sure that making a pledge to Jeff for the MS150 has simply slipped your mind.  Well the ride is this weekend, time is running out and we need you!

Enron's goal is to raise $700,000, and Jeff's personal goal is to raise $50,000.  As of today, we are a little better than half way there.  Won't you consider helping him reach his goal?

Thanks for your consideration.  I look forward to hearing from you tomorrow...

Sherri :-)
