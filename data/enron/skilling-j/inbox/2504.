Technology spending soared in the 1990s, amid a booming economy and the dual promise and threat of the Internet. But the binge is over and - billions of dollars later - technology leaders now face uncertain returns on those investments. 
The Forrester Technology Leadership Forum will focus on incremental investments that will help you achieve payoff from your firm's technology assets. The key is Web services technologies, which help companies build and link systems within and between organizations, regardless of location or platform. Web services deliver real benefits; they lower integration and connection costs, improve productivity, and foster more agile partnerships, while preserving the value of legacy IT systems. Forrester analysts will tell you how you can use Web services today to differentiate and accelerate growth. You'll also hear from leaders at vendor and user companies that are creating and deploying best-in-class Web services.
