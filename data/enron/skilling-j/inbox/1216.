"Pathways to Success:  What it Takes to Move from Dorm Room to Board Room in Two Easy Decades" - Dinner and Discussion  Club
Following upon the rousing success of the Club's first Harvard Forum "Raising Children of Character in A World of Affluence," the Harvard Club of Houston is conducting another Harvard Forum.  We plan to have three during the current academic year.
For those of you unfortunate enough to have missed the first Forum, the format works like this:  we'll have dinner, and then a panel of Harvard grads will give brief introductions to the evening's topic from their perspective, and then we will all engage the topic for ourselves in a moderated discussion.  The panel members will be knowledgeable, but not so expert that anyone will be intimidated.  They will, however, be provocative to assure that the subsequent conversation is lively.  You will come away knowing your fellow Club members better than ever - maybe better than you ever wanted.
We hope that the topic we've picked for the second Forum will be captivating to recent and older alumni alike.  Our panelists will cover the spectrum of vocational experience, not all business people; and you might argue whether some even have a vocation.  Some will identify the critical factors in achieving success, while others will argue that all personal planning is an exercise in self-delusion.  We are confident that the discussion will be informative and lively.
Because of the format, only the first 40 people can be accepted.  We had to turn away people last time, so please respond promptly, as indicated below.
When:    Saturday, September 22, 7:30 p.m.
Where:   Briar Club, 2603 Timmons (East Briar Room)
Cost:      $35.00 per person
