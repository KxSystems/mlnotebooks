Jeff:

This is just a quick "head's up" to advise you that I am no longer retired
and am CEO of an energy information start-up, Genscape, Inc., based in
Louisvllle.  Two founders (32 year olds) left power trading positions to
pursue the development of technology able to measure the electric and
magnetic fields emanating from high-voltage lines connected to power plants.
They were successful and can now translate those measurements into highly
accurate estimates of transmission line load and direction and from that
make a highly accurate estimate of a power plant's generating status.  The
information is delivered to customers via Internet on a real-time basis.
Genscape will by year end have built a monitoring network capable of
monitoring 250+ plants or startegic transmission points in the Continental
U.S.  Genscape's initial customers are energy trading companies and
subsequent customers will be power generators, transmission and distribution
operators, insurers, fuel suppliers and transporters, regulators and
wholesale power consumers.

The reason for the "head's up" at this time is that I'll be meeting with
Scott Tholan of your staff on Tuesday, May 1, to review Genscape's product.
