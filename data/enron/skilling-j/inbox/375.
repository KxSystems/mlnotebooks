Jeff,

I have been researching Enron and understand some of the difficulties with
running global applications.
Many companies have problems with database replication over a wide area
network.  Traditional database replication is great for local area
replication within one data center.  Once you scale to multiple data
centers, traditional replication is unreliable, complicated to set up and
manage, and very expensive.

Zembu's software was designed to address this exact problem.  Our data
replication and synchronization solution can be used with 2 to n
geographically dispersed data centers.  Zembu also alleviates problems with:

-Global application performance
-Real time data sharing among multiple data centers
-24/7/365 application availability
-Cost effective scaling

Zembu can be used for unique log on applications, internal and/or external
applications.

I like to talk with someone at Enron to see if using Zembu as part of your
e-infrastructure and architecture would be beneficial to you.  We can
determine this quickly via a brief conference call.  Who should I speak
with?

Sincerely,
Fran Compagno
