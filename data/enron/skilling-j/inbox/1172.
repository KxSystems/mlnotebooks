    Thursday, September 20, 2001 Issue 37   EDITORIAL  Last week's events  =
As most of you may know, Eyeforenergy held its second annual, Energy Exchan=
ges Online  conference last week in New Orleans.  We'd like to thank the wo=
nderful speakers and sponsors who made the event a very successful one.  Fo=
r those of you interested in what went on you can take a look at the presen=
tations which are up on the website here .   Normally, after a conference, =
we'd devote the newsletter to a wrap-up of the conference, some major trend=
s we picked out, etc.  With the events of the last week, however, we though=
t it fitting that this newsletter focus on the effects wreaked on the energ=
y sector by the recent terrorist attacks.  So in the article below you'll g=
et a look at some possible scenarios for the next few months.   We'd like t=
o once again extend our sympathy to the members of the Eyeforenergy communi=
ty who have lost friends and colleagues, particularly our friends at Trades=
park and eSpeed.  (For those of you interested in making a donation to Cant=
or Fitzgerald, parent company of Tradespark and eSpeed, please go to http:/=
/www.espeed.com/donation.html )   One of the best things about the job we d=
o is the opportunity we get to meet some extraordinary people in the course=
 of putting together our events.  It makes it all the harder when we know t=
hat we won't be seeing our trusted friends at the next one.    --Allison Ro=
bertshaw, Editor    FOCUS   The Sound of Silence   Last week's tragic event=
s struck at the heart of the energy sector and the world will never be the =
same. While some of us lost family, friends, acquaintances and business ass=
ociates, all of us share in the loss. Nationals of 47 countries have been d=
eclared dead or missing and 58 countries report some of their citizens, sai=
d to have been in the United States on September 11, are still among the 5,=
700 unaccounted for.  For those of us attending the Energy Exchanges Online=
 II conference in New Orleans, it was particularly emotional as we watched =
some of our friends and associates come to the realization that their offic=
