Brother Benson,     Congratulations on taking over the top spot in the
Best-of-ewooglin.com-contest.   Those pathetic losers of '75 have been
shoving our faces in it for too long.  After all, whose class was Doug Dyer
in after all?  Sorry I can't come to D this w/e.  Got to go to parents
weekend for my college freshman.  Don't forget to tune in to the Sooners
stomping Nebraska.

At Homecoming 2000, the BETA TENT had the biggest crowd by far.  Stay connected and consider a future homecoming BETA reunion.  It's incredible...forget the 20 years in between...everyone just seems to pick it up right where they left off years ago.
