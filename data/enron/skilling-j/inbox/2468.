HAPPY HOLLOWEEN  FROM SAMURAIMAI  (#457 CLASS OF  '73)                          
  Regarding U T winning the national championship.  What a  JOKE!  I have 
arranged to have the "JUNIOR COLLEGE'S" TOWER here in  Austin demolished, as 
it is the preferred site for the proposed Blanton  Museum.  The tower will 
never glow orange again.  It's also on  the second tier target list for the 
raghead's next flyby.
Best  regards.  -KAI-
At Homecoming 2000, the BETA TENT had the  biggest crowd by far.  Stay connected and consider a future homecoming  BETA reunion.  It's incredible...forget the 20 years in  between...everyone just seems to pick it up right where they left off years  ago.
