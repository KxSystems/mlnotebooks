5 out of 5 stars A great book about a great team., August 27,  2001=20
Reviewer: A reader from Dallas, TX USA =20
Jim  Dent's Junction Boys was one of the greatest sports books I ever read,=
 so I  couldn't wait for his next one. It's a different kind of story, but =
this book is  wonderful too. Dent knows how to make his characters come ali=
ve, from the great  coach, Bud Wilkinson, to all those great players, and t=
here were quite a few  during the Streak. No, Wilkinson isn't portrayed as =
a saint here, because he  wasn't--he was a human being, and that's how Dent=
 shows him, warts and all. I'd  rather read the truth, and if John Herman B=
ell says "this book is as true as  true can be" (that's what he told the Da=
ily Oklahoman), that's good enough for  me. The best part of the book is ge=
tting to know all those great players, and  reading about all those great g=
ames they played--and there were some great  games. Also, getting behind th=
e scenes is really cool, to see how the players  and the coaches prepared (=
or didn't). There are a lot of funny stories, too. All  in all, a great fol=
low-up to the great Junction Boys.=20
