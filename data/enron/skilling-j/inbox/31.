Hi Sherri--
    It's great hearing from you.  Really enjoyed meeting you at the
Inauguration and must apologize for not having communicated that to you
before this.
    I had forgotten about the photo---am dying to see it!  My address is:

                           6033 North Sheridan Road  Unit 31C
                           Chicago, Illinois 60618

    You are very kind to contact me on this.  Thank Jeff for his
thoughtfulness on this.  I had a wonderful time see Jeff and Jeffrey and
meeting you, your husband, Rebecca and many others from Enron.  What a nice
group all of you are!
    Hope all is well and give my best to Jeff!

                                 Tom

Greetings, Tom.  I have a great picture of you, Jeff and Jeffrey at the
Inauguration that Jeff asked me to send to you.  Unfortunately, I don't
have a mailing address for you.  If you would please e-mail me your
address, I'll get the picture right out to you.  Thanks, and hope all is
well!  SRS
