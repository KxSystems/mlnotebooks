TO:                 HOUSTON ANGEL NETWORK MEMBERS
 
FROM:            MICHELLE WEISBLATT
 
 
Good morning!
 
HAN has established an agenda planning committee, for
the purpose of setting the agenda for the monthly HAN
meetings.  Specifically, we will meet to discuss 
the companies who have submitted applications to
either HAN or HTC, and determine who will present at
the next HAN meeting in October.  All HAN members are
welcome at this committee meeting, and all present will
participate in the selection process.    The meeting
details are:
 
*Purpose:          To select presenting companies for the October HAN Meeting
*Date:               Thursday, October 4th
*Time:                7:30-9:00 AM
*Location:          Koch Building, 20 E. Greenway Plaza
 
A complimentary, continental breakfast will be served.
However, please RSVP to Michelle Weisblatt either by phone at (713)
533-9986 or by e-mail at mweisblatt@yahoo.com.
 
Many of you may be working with companies who are
candidates to present.  If so, these companies should
submit the attached application, create a 2-page
summary using the HAN template (also attached), and
submit the $250 application fee via credit card either
directly to me or in the space provided on the
application.  Our deadline for the applications to be
considered for the October breakfast will be 12:00 PM
on October 2.  All applications that are submitted
prior to the deadline will be posted on the website on
October 2, so that Angels can review them before our
Agenda Planning meeting on October 4th.  Companies
selected for presentation will pay an additional $750
presentation fee.
 
Please send the attached application and template to
any companies who you would like to be considered as a
candidate for the October breakfast.  Any candidates
not selected for October will be considered for
subsequent months.
 
As always, if you have any questions, please call me
at (713) 533-9986.
 
Regards,
 
Michelle Weisblatt
