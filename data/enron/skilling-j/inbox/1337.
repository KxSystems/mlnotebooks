Buyout and investment firm Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst of Dallas, which
declared last November that it would make no new venture investments, has
also decided it will not provide follow-on financings to any of the dozen
startups it has already backed. It's part of the New Reality of Private
Equity that Jack Furst will discuss at the September 11 lunch.

About HMTF: Founded in 1989, Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst Incorporated (HMTF)
is a leading private equity investment firm specializing in leveraged
acquisitions. The firm's primary objective is to acquire a diversified
portfolio of companies serving the manufacturing, media and food sectors of
the economy that offer the potential for attaining exceptional capital
appreciation.

HMTF and its predecessor have successfully completed over $50 billion of
leveraged transactions. In addition to the firm's primary focus on
leveraged acquisitions, HMTF, through affiliated entities -- including
TCW/Crescent Mezzanine Partners, Olympus Real Estate Corporation, Stratford
Capital Partners and 21st Century Group -- is also actively engaged in the
management of other specialized asset categories, including high-yield and
mezzanine securities, real estate, Small Business Investment Company (SBIC)
debt and equity investments, and private equity investments in
minority-owned businesses.

About speaker:  Jack D. Furst has been a partner of HMTF since the year it
was founded. He has more than 18 years of experience in private equity
investments. At HMTF, he is involved in all aspects of the firm's business
and has been actively involved in originating, structuring and monitoring
investments. Prior to joining HMTF, Mr. Furst was a vice president and
subsequently a partner of Hicks & Haas Incorporated. Previously, he was a
merger and acquisition/corporate finance specialist for First Boston
Corporation in New York and a financial consultant at Price Waterhouse.

Mr. Furst received his BS degree in business from Arizona State University
and his MBA from the University of Texas. He was inducted into the Arizona
State University College of Business Hall of Fame in 1999.
