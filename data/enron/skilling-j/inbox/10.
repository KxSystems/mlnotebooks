SnapStream Media - Personal Video Server Technology

SnapStream Media's goal is to use its proprietary networked video management
and streaming technology to become a major infrastructure player in the
booming markets of home digital media delivery and viewing. Chosen as a
finalist for Best of Show at the Consumer Electronics Show 2001, SnapStream
Media software enables any network appliance to watch or stream video over
wireless and wired networks. SnapStream's technology delivers the only
network-centric media solution in the market. More than 150,000 users have
downloaded SnapStream's software since its first beta release and reviews
have been written by both PC Magazine and PC World.

Product

		SnapStream Personal Video Station (PVS) serves as a personal
network-based repository of digital media. Content can be recorded from a
variety of sources including satellite, cable and antenna. Additionally,
through content partnerships, shows can also be "recorded" via a user's
broadband connection.
		The SnapStream.NET Back-end Services allows the company to
provide a variety of services including collection of viewing patterns and
statistics, delivery of customized advertising, and network-based delivery
of video content.
		The company is pursuing a strategy of bundling and
co-marketing to achieve penetration into the market.  In the short-term,
revenues of approximately $5 / subscriber / month will be derived for
services associated with SnapStream PVS.  Longer term, revenues will be
derived from the network-based delivery of video (movies, television shows,
news broadcasts, etc.) to the SnapStream base of viewers.

Market

		The target market is the exploding market of digital media
consumers.
		The Internet appliance market is forecasted to grow to $17.8
billion by 2004 (IDC**)
		Handheld device unit sales doubled in 2000 from 3.6M units
in 1999 to 6.9M units and are expected to grow to 33.5M units ($26B sales)
by 2004 (IDC*).
		The nascent digital home entertainment network market will
grow to $3.3 billion from 2001 to 2004 (Parks and Associates)
		By 2004, home networking device shipments are expected to
reach 29.8M, and 17.6M U.S. homes are expected to have home networks (IDC*).
		Annual shipments of digital video recorders are expected to
reach 12.9M by 2004 (IDC*).

Strategic Partners

		SnapStream Media has established bundling agreements with
leading TV tuner card manufacturers. One partner, Hauppauge Computer Works,
is the U.S. market-leading manufacturer for TV tuner cards.
		The company is in advanced discussions with Intel
Corporation around the bundling of PVS software with Intel Anypoint Home
Networking hardware. The company is also in high-level discussions with
other key home networking companies including 3Com and Linksys.

Competition

		SnapStream's competitors are in the convergence media space
and include companies such as Mediabolic, ZapMedia, and SonicBlue.
		Except for SonicBlue, all companies are in their early
stages and have not begun product sales.
		The technologies and products of these convergence media
companies address only digital audio (as opposed to digital video) giving
SnapStream a strong early-mover advantage.
		SnapStream Media holds technical expertise in the area of
streaming video, rivaled only by streaming video companies Microsoft, Apple
and Real Networks, making it difficult for other companies to compete
		SnapStream's support of consumer operating systems from
Microsoft make it convenient and cost-effective for its software to be
bundled with PCs from companies such as HP, Gateway, Compaq and Dell.
		The company's pending patent covering its networked video
platform will allow the company to further impose barriers to entry for
existing and new market players.
Competitive Advantages

		Network Video Technology - To date, SnapStream Media's
]existing streaming server currently available to the consumer market. Its
networked personal television software (SnapStream PVS) is something for
which the company has filed a patent to protect its intellectual property
position.
		Early Mover Advantage - As discussed above, the company has
a substantial lead in both vision and implemented technology in the area of
digital and networked video in the home.
