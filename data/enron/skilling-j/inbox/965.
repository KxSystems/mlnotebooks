Votenet Announces Online Voter Registration Software in Spanish

Washington, D.C. - In support of today's White House celebration of the National Hispanic Heritage Month, Votenet Solutions, Inc. is pleased to announce the Spanish language version of its pioneering Votenet Voter Registration software. The Spanish speaking population in the United States increased by an unprecedented 13 million or 62 % from 22 million in 1990 to 35 million in 2000! The political ramifications of this demographic change are expected to be far reaching. The first step in becoming an involved and informed citizen is registering to vote.  Votenet's Registro De Votacion will provide Hispanic Americans a streamlined and simplified approach to the voter registration process. 
Associations and advocacy groups can add the online voter registration software to their web sites for as little as $995.00 per year.  The features in Spanish include: 
Register to vote  
Report a name change to the voter registration office 
Report a change of address to the voter registration office 
Register with a political party 

Votenet's Voter Registration software will have a dramatic impact in areas with large Hispanic populations including: Florida, Texas, New York, and California.  All of these areas were critical in the 2000 election cycle.  "With only 50% of Americans voting at the national level, this software enhancement has the ability to raise that number significantly," stated Mitch Reisberg, Vice President of Votenet's Sales. 
"We are very excited about adding the Voter Registration in Spanish capability to the Votenet suite of public policy solutions. We believe this product enhancement will add a unique dynamic to voter activism.  All American citizens should exercise their right to vote and Votenet Voter Registration facilitates the first step; registering to vote.  This Spanish language version recognizes the reality that the Hispanic population is the fastest growing segment in the United States," said Glen Hughlette, President and CEO of Votenet Solutions. 
The online Voter Registration product, in English and/or Spanish, is available from Votenet Solutions.  Interested groups can learn how to license the software by visiting either http://www.votenet.com  or calling 1-800-VOTENET.
