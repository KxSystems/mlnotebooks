I spent 5 straight days in June playing golf and partying with G'bles and he
never said a word.  I talked to him Sunday night after I got your e-mail.  I
gave him hell for not confiding in me, but I understand his reasons.  I
would probably do the same.  He knows how much he means to all of us.  And
the feeling is mutual.   I'm so happy  to hear all is well.  I talked to
brother Charlie Porter (now a famous KC cardiologist) Sunday and he gave me
some comfort.   G'bles is coming back to KC soon to play more golf.  I can't
wait to give him a hug and let more -kai- flow.  The Beta brothers are the
greatest!
