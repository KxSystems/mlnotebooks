Dear Jeff, 

I just wanted to let you know that I thought your talk last night was inspirational.  

I have been working in the San Francisco office for 2 years helping to permit sites for generating facilities.  During this time our team have had to endure more than our fair share of irrational and misinformed individuals.  One thing they didn't teach me at business school was how to educate people in a hostile and political environment while maintaining your dignity and humility.  Your example last night has certainly set a new personal standard for me to strive for.

Sincerely 

Victor Browner
