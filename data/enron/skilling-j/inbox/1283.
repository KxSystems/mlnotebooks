Dear Angel Investor,
 
Please mark your calendar for the September, Houston Angel Network Breakfast meeting on September 19.  Details of the meeting are as follows:
 
DATE:               Wednesday, September 19, 2001
TIME:                7:00-9:00 AM (Registration, 7:00-7:30)
LOCATION:       The Houstonian, 111 N. Post Oak Blvd.
COST:              $45
 
Four companies will be presenting.  Two of the four companies have been confirmed and there are several others that are being evaluated by the HAN steering committee.  I have attached executive summaries for the two companies that are confirmed.  Also, we have scheduled follow up meetings for interested investors according to the following schedule:
 
Meetrix:  10:00 AM, September 26, 5450 NW Central, Ste. 230, Houston, TX 77092
 
Fiber Dynamics:  9:00 AM, September 25, 1100 Louisiana, Ste. 5005, Houston, TX 77002
 
If you are interested in attending any of the follow up meetings, please mark your calendars.  
 
Lastly, I am attaching an Angel breakfast sign-up form.  Please note that if you intend to bring guests to the breakfast, or if you have never completed an Angel application with the HTC, you should complete the attached form IN ADVANCE.  Although we will not require that the membership fee be paid, we will ask that all attendees who have not completed a form submit one prior to or on the day of the breakfast.  It will significantly expedite the check-in process if these forms are completed in advance.  Also, please remember to register your guests in advance with Kathy Nethercutt at knethercutt@houstontech.org  or call 713.658.1750, so that we have proper accommodations for everyone in terms of seating, food, etc.  
 
 
Best regards,
 
Kerry Brooks and Michelle Weisblatt
 
Thank you for your interest in the Houston Technology Center
