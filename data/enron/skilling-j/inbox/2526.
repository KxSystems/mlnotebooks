ELVIS :
 
FINE !..........I always liked you  better when I thought you were from Summit, NJ. The reason for the question,  d---head, was since I didn't get a response from Mr. Haulenbeek I thought ,  perhaps, I wasn't reaching him, especially since there had been some talk about  some Betas no longer being on the list, etc, so there. And please say  HELLO to the very lovely Margaret.

C-PAUL and Artie :   Thanks for  responding in a very civil and cordial manner. It shows you are at least  educated and have developed manners!   By the way Chuck, what ever  happened to those people we played spades with : El Sheldon, Barry etc

HELLO 
Zeebs,  you've been using this site for weeks and you still don't know how it works?  I've got some lake front lots for sale that I want to discuss with you. I'll  make you a Beta brother deal.

At  Homecoming 2000, the BETA TENT had the biggest crowd by far.  Stay  connected and consider a future homecoming BETA reunion.  It's  incredible...forget the 20 years in between...everyone just seems to pick it  up right where they left off years ago.
