Fred,  good investigating!!  With a name like Caldwell Willig, it must be
the same one!  I think Caldwell still owes me about .30 from the dimes that
he used to bum from me for dime beer nights at the Stables!!

Woody,
Good work on making contact with Joe Parks and successfully recruiting
him as a new member of EWooglin.com.
On the strength of your success, I started searching the Internet and
Louisville for Caldwell Willig.  The last time I saw him was in NYC in
the late seventies...the result of a chance meeting on the street after a
get together of metropolitan area Betas.  Zeebs will remember.  It was
the night I told the Long Island duck joke at a crowed restaurant in his
home town (inhibitions were low as usual).
"Where is Caldwell Willig?"  Is this our Caldwell Willig
(http://louisville.bcentral.com/louisville/stories/1998/08/03/story6.html
), or is our Caldwell a "Jr.", "II", "III" or 'IV"?
Any insight brothers?...let me know.

At Homecoming 2000, the BETA TENT had the biggest crowd by far.  Stay
connected and consider a future homecoming BETA reunion.  It's
incredible...forget the 20 years in between...everyone just seems to pick it
up right where they left off years ago.
