Dear Mr. Skilling:
Just a quick little note. I would very much like to talk to you when you get
a chance.  My guess is that you will probably be taking some time off for
awhile.  When you do have some time, please give me a call.  I specialize in
the finance(VC and Investment Banks) arena and would love to present someone
of your caliber to them.  That is of course, if you are interested in
possibly going into that arena.
Sincerely

Ed Vigil
