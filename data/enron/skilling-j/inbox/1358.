My Dear Beta Brothers:

    I would like to report on the fabulous show of support displayed by my
many Beta brothers this weekend at my book unveiling in Norman -- Woody,
Benson and Grumbles from Dallas; Porter and C-Ci from Tulsa, along with
Strange and Ellsworth from OKC. Hess tried to get there, but a cancellation
in the original party venue kept us from seeing him.

    Thank God I am a Beta. I was touched beyond belief to see your smiling
faces Friday night, especially during a time when I am catching shit here.
The original party was cancelled three days in advance a Nazi named Dr.
David Boren, the president of OU (and faggot), who was pressured by the
monied assholes, who were siced on me by Jay Wilkinson, who didn't like the
things I wrote about his father, which, the way, are true.

     My brothers were wonderful this weekend, in spite of the fact that
Woody heckled me during my speech, and Grumbles tried to hustle my best
Sunday girl. I guess Woody had a right. He drove all the way from Atlanta,
then had to turn around drive back to Dallas after the party. But, Woody,
you still owe me for conspiring with Hutch to shut me out of the Beta
offense.

    Back to Hess. My most humble apology. (I have sent a personal email to
Hess). I thought everyone knew that the party had moved, but, as it turned
out, he slipped through the cracks. I put a notice on the Beta wire about
the change and signs were posted at the Sam Noble Museum. By by the time
Hess arrived, the place was dark and closed. Sorry brother Hess. I will make
it up to you somehow.

    Guys, you are the greatest, and the best friends I've ever had in my
life.

Brother Del Dent
