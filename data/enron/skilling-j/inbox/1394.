Subject: [smu-betas] Soooooooo you gots a  problem wit my Double wide
More Okie  Betas
[IMAGE][IMAGE]Here I am 50 years old and what have I done with my  life?  W=
ell I do have the  Double-Wide , and the little lady Patsy Joe Dale Bob.  A=
nd the illegitimate children.  Caroline JoeDale Bob on who I spent all my a=
luminum can money , sending her to  Boston College, & Holly JoeDale Bob who=
 will use up the winnings from the  chicken fights sending her to college i=
n South Carolina, then there is little  Tommy Joe Dale Bob who takes after =
me; he gets the Double wide when I'm gone,  and special  Janie Jane Jane Jo=
e  Dale Bob our baby who works down at the A&W to support our propane  usag=
e.   But surely there is  more to Life.  Had I not consumed  all those free=
 beers at Gordos I would have had more of those brain cells and  I too coul=
d have been as successful as the Betas that followed me. I feel so  inadequ=
ate when I am invariably compared to the likes of Strobes,  Dent, Rocky, an=
d you know there's Drow  plus that most successful Clay Coburn.   I will fe=
el like the impudent Senior Citizen I am when Johnny Miller  pulls up the I=
nternet link to his front-page success article and the others in  the class=
 of the class of 75.  I  can only hope Beek, my little brother Bless his he=
art, will send me a Good  pornographic joke.

AND Gall Darn It I forgot  two other OKIE Betas  Thems Robert  Margo , Joe =
Parks and Paul Porter.
