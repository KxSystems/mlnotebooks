WELL I HOPE NOT TO BORE YOU GOOD BETA BROTHERS, BUT I RECENTLY SUBSCRIBED TO
THIS WEBSITE JUST BECAUSE IT INTRIGUIED ME AND ALSO BROUGHT BACK MANY
MEMORIES FRO ME AS WELL.   I UNDERSTAND THAT FOR THE MOST PART, Y'ALL ARE
BROTHERS FRO THE CLASSE OF OF '72 -75.  WELL, I'M FROM THE CLASS OF THE '69.
WHICHEVER ONE OF YOU GUYS WAS SO OBSESSED WITH WHO # 378 WAS CAN FORGET
ABOUT THAT.  I'M # 267!  AND AS FAR AS I CAN TELL, I'M STILL ALIVE.!  IN
FACT, EVEN THOUGH I 'VE LIVED IN HOUSTON SINCE '73 WHEN I GOT OUT OF LAW
SCOOL AT SMU, I 'VE HAD SEASON TICKETS FOR THE PONY FOOTBALL GAMES TO THIS
DATE.  THERE'VE BEEN SOME GOOD TIME TIMES AND SOME BAD TIMES - BUT I STILL
LOVE MY MUSTANGS IN FB AND IN BB - NO MATTER WHAT!

AS FAR AS THE REFERENCE TO "COME-ALOT" IS CONCERNED, I HAVE TO INFORM YOU
GUYS THAT IT WAS WRITTEN BY 2 OF OUR BROTYHERS IN 1967 - TEE WATKINS, '68
AND BILL DARROUGH, '68 WITH A LOT OF HELP FROM RANDY HENRY, '68.  WE WON
MANADA WITH "COME-ALOT" IN '67 AND '68.  BUT BEFORE THAT, THE SAME GREAT
WRITERS PUT TOGETHER "MOPY DICK" WITH WHICH WE ALSO WON MANADA FOR 2 TWO
YEARS IN A ROW!  YOU GUYS ACTUALLY MISSED THE BEST THAT GAMMA OMEGA EVER
PRODUCED!  MOPY DICK SOLD OUT WHILE THER WERE NO LINES IN FRONT OF THE SAE,
PHI DELT, OR FIGI TENTS.  EVERYBODY ON CAMPUS WAS IN LINE FOR TICKETS TO
MOPY DICK.  AND, AS AN ASIDE WE ALSO WON THE OLYMPICS THAT AFTERNOON.  IN
OTHER WORDS, WE KICKED ASS FOR ABOUT FOUR YEARS IN MANADA!

I GUESS I'VE DRONED ON TOO LONG ABOUT THINGS WHICH OCCURED BEFORE YOU GUYS
('72-78) BECAME BETAS.  BUT THIS BOARD MIGHT BE A MEANS BY WHICH MY OLD
CRONIES CAN GET INVOLVED TOO!  I'M INCRDIBLY IMPRESSED WITH HOW YOU HUYS
HAVE STAYED IN TOUCH AND HAVE KEPT -KAI- GOING AMONG YOU.  I ONLY WISH THAT
IT COULD BE REVIVED WITH MY BROTHERS AS WELL.

REGARDS,

DICK DENT '69
