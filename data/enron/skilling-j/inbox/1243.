Attached is a summary compiling separate discussions between myself and Jeff
Skilling, Cris / Lee (McKinsey), Mike Burke, Lloyd Bentsen and Paul Frison.
As indicated in the attachment it has been determined the October 22 event
will stand with slight modifications regarding the invitations.  In
addition, HTC will attempt to organize a second event that will afford
participants the opportunity to hear and hold discussions regarding current
concerns among their colleagues.

A conference call has been scheduled for tomorrow, Friday from 10:00-10:30
with Cris and Lee to further discuss a title and 1-3 paragraph write-up for
the invitations.

Please forward to my attention suggestions, recommendations and comments.

Regards,
Robert Cossick
