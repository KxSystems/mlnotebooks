Yo Buckethead. I guess I was the one feeling lonely and blue. Hadn't seen a
frigging thing on the Beta wire for ten days other than the dopers and
drinkers hating each other back in the seventies. Hey, I loved both sides.

Anyway, I see that you have incensed the unfortunate young men we pledged
back in that golden autumn of '72...As Blackie Sherrod might write,
"Scattershooting while wondering while wondering whatever happened to the
Class of 1976."
