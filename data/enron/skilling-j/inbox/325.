Jeff --

The buzz from your Players segment on the trading floor will  create a big  buzz
among our audience when it airs  Sunday, May 20th on CNN at 5:30 CST. It was
great meeting you. Thanks for your  fresh outlook on leadership  and for your
candor on your plans to make Enron the world's largest company. Judging by the
energy around headquarters, "Houston's not going to have a problem"
accomplishing just that.

We're working with Vance on internal promotion, so that all Enron employees can
tune in, and we'll also send copies of the interview  in the next week .

As I mentioned, I have done over 70 of these interviews...around the
world......and your combination of charisma and smarts and brevity is at the top
of the list.

Enjoyed meeting you, and hope to see you at the Olympics in Salt Lake!


Regards,
Don Currin
