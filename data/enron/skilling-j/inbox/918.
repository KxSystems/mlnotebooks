Shack,  I am flying into Big D for the Big Weekend and hope many of you out
there will be as well.  My brother (literally) Mark, is having a get
together at his house in Richardson on Saturday night for those who come in
from out of town or live in the area.   Mark's house is about 1/2 mile from
Woody Berry's and one street over from Tom Benson's.  Festivities will
commence at/or about 7PM.  In order for Mark to have some sort of a 'head
count,' please e-mail him:  mark.paul@rssmb.com

Mark/ Jenay Paul
205 Bridge Canyon Court
Richardson, Tex
972-669-2849

We hope you can make it!!

-kai-

Chuck
