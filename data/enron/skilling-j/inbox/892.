Shacklepuss,
   OK, I'm sitting here extremely remorseful.  I was wrong to attack you in
such a mean spirited way.  I'm sorry.  I apologize.  Will you please find it
in your most kind heart of hearts to forgive me?


Yours always in -kai-
Drow

PS.  BLOW ME

At Homecoming 2000, the BETA TENT had the biggest crowd by far.  Stay connected and consider a future homecoming BETA reunion.  It's incredible...forget the 20 years in between...everyone just seems to pick it up right where they left off years ago.
