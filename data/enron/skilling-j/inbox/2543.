Carl,
    That's a great idea and is one the men there are already trying to work
on.  As you might imagine, relations with the black frat are a bit raw
emotionally right now, but it's a good idea.

Thanks,
Drow

PS.  By the way, that's quite possibly the very first intelligent thing I've
ever hear you articulate in, oh, about 30 years or so.

At Homecoming 2000, the BETA TENT had the biggest crowd by far.  Stay connected and consider a future homecoming BETA reunion.  It's incredible...forget the 20 years in between...everyone just seems to pick it up right where they left off years ago.
