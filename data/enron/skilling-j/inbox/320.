 Hi- This afternoon at 5pm I have a  conference call with moderators from forums 1,3,5 along
 with Johnny Duncan  to determine  draft order for upcoming Forum draw. J. Hines has agreed
 to head the selection of the new Forum as  his Forum is not going to participate. My understanding
 is that your Forum  would pass on this draft as well ...our goal is that by next year all Forums  would
 have 9-11 members with 10 as a norm target... according  to my records you should be there by
 participating in next years draft...I believe this will  leave 7-8 for the new Forum along with 1 or 2
 veterans to form its nucleus..Please email me if you  have any thoughts that are contrary to my thinking
 or if you wish to be on the call, please notify me or  Vivian asap....
 
Craig
