Shacklepuss,
    Sorry it took a couple of days to get back, but HEY I WORK FOR A LIVING
(old Steve Martin line).  Not to worry, never was good enough waxing lyrical
to charge for it like brother Dent does with his semi-overpriced missives.
Someday perhaps, someday.  Insofar as you Treasurer watch goes, I'm still
seeing a psychotherapist trying to learn to forgive you for letting Roby
talk you into billing the chapter for about 400 $5,000 life insurance
policies he milked the brothers into buying when he worked for MONY.  Let it
go Drow, let it go.

Yours in -kai-,
Drow

At Homecoming 2000, the BETA TENT had the biggest crowd by far.  Stay connected and consider a future homecoming BETA reunion.  It's incredible...forget the 20 years in between...everyone just seems to pick it up right where they left off years ago.
