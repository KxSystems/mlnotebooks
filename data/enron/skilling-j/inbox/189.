Dear Mr. Skilling,

	My name is Chris Weekley and I am David and Bonnie Weekley's son.   I am
writing because I am in search of a summer internship (paid or non-paid).  I
recently had out of town plans fall through and this is why I am beginning
this process seemingly late.  I am a junior at Vanderbilt University and I am
majoring in Human and Organization Development with a focus on Leadership
Effectiveness.  This major studies organizations and the human interactions
that allow them to effectively operate.  I have taken various courses in
organizational theory, economics and human relations.   I think it would be a
great opportunity for me to gain experience within Enron.  I would be more
than happy with any type of job from research to customer relations.  For the
first three weeks of summer I will be a counselor at a Christian sports camp
leaving me available from June 11th until August 8th.  I am trying to tie
something down in the next few days prior to my departure for camp if at all
possible.  Thank you so much for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Chris Weekley
