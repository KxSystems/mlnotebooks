Dear Houston Technology Forum Attendee:

On behalf of Houston Technology Center and Summit Registration, we hope that
you have a safe and enjoyable Memorial Day holiday.  Please remember that
the day you return -- Tuesday, May 29th -- is The Houston Technology Forum.

Registration for the Forum begins at 10:45 a.m.  You many wish to park in
surface lots near the Hyatt Regency (1200 Louisiana), or you may opt to
valet park at the Hyatt.  Valet parking will be discounted to $7.00 with the
validation stickers that HTC will provide.  Please bring your parking
ticket, and stickers will be available at the end of the program as you're
leaving.

Please arrive at the Hyatt as close to 10:45 a.m. as possible, keeping in
mind that the other 1,029 Forum attendees will be arriving as well and
needing to park or valet.  The earlier you arrive, the more time you'll have
for networking and enjoying your lunch.  Luncheon service will begin at
approximately 11:20 a.m., and there will be no food service after noon.

When you enter the Hyatt Regency, please proceed upstairs to the third
floor.  Check-in will be in the foyer outside the Imperial Ballroom.  Name
badges will be arranged alphabetically by individual attendee's last name.
If you have been appointed as a substitute between Friday and Tuesday, you
will need to find the line for the person's last name for whom you are
substituting to get your badge.

If your plans have changed, and you need to cancel, please go online by noon
on Friday to cancel your reservation.  If you receive a confirmed
cancellation by noon, your account will be credited.  No cancellations or
refunds will be accepted after noon on Friday.

If you are a primary contact for a full table, please pass this message on
to the other guests at your table. We look forward to seeing you on Tuesday.
