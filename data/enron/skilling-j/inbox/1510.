Greetings Jeff:

Hope all is well.  I hear that my cameo in the video upstaged the pie....

If there's anything I can do to assist on the request from Chambers, just let me know.

All the best,
Jeff

Mr. Skilling,

I am the Director of Government Affairs at Cisco and work for John Chambers 
on broadband issues. John is currently one of 8 CEOs on a broadband task 
force at TechNet that will drive our broadband policy agenda in the US. 
TechNet (http://www.technet.org) is a 250+ tech CEO-driven policy/political 
group.

We are interested in meeting with the someone in your Broadband Services 
Group to discuss some of our ideas regarding a business and policy 
strategy, and hoping you could direct us to the appropriate person(s).

Many thanks and regards from John.
