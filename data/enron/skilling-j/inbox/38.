   Tomorrow night, come enjoy the sunset with HTC and mixer underwriter The
Tenagra Corp. (http://www.tenagra.com) on SkyBar's penthouse patio!

          Digital Mixer
          SkyBar
          3400 Montrose
          Thursday, 4.19.01
          5:30 p.m. - 8:00 p.m.
          $3 at the door

  Bring your clients, coworkers and friends, as SkyBar is giving us the
entire club with two outdoor patios and two bars for the mixer.    Parking
is available in the four-story garage adjacent to SkyBar; for parking
information, ask the SkyBar valet guys.  Please don't park at Kroger's --
they tow!

  Hope to see you there!
