    Thursday, May 31, 2001 Issue 29   EDITORIAL  Today and Tomorrow-what As=
ia faces and what we've all learned from the past  As you probably know, th=
e Eyeforenergy team is off to Mexico next week for our Latin American e-bus=
iness in energy conference.  But to prove that our interests are global, ou=
r Insight article this week focuses on the state of the energy in Asia.  Li=
ke their colleagues in Latin America, Europe and North America, energy exec=
utives in Asia are facing a host of changes-e-business, regulatory changes,=
 and the commercialization of alternative and micro energy sources.  All of=
 these are examined in the article below, and it paints an interesting pict=
ure of the state of play in Asia today and what sort of challenges they fac=
e tomorrow.   In other news, the move towards online trading continues apac=
e in the energy industry (unlike recent developments in most other industri=
es) with announcements by Pantellos and Duke Energy North America.  Pantell=
os' move into the international arena with its procurement solution points =
towards the increasing use of online marketplaces in the energy supply chai=
n (or at least a refusal to give up in the wake of Petrocosm's demise).    =
  While Duke's announcement of their move to OpenLink's software points tow=
ards the increasing use of Internet technology on the commodity side of ene=
rgy trading.   Either way, the energy sector seems to be one of the few bri=
ght spots in the wake of the dot com gloom. The energy industry's measured =
response and refusal to jump on the e-commerce bandwagon at the start seems=
 to be proving dividends now.  Perhaps the rest of the new economy is learn=
ing what it seemed that the energy industry always knew-the Internet is jus=
t another tool (a useful one, but just a tool) and at the end of the day yo=
u still need to get the oil out of the ground and the electricity to the cu=
stomers.         Q&A   Mirroring the Marketplace   Founded in late 1997, Ex=
celergy Corporation, Lexington, Mass., a developer of software products and=
 technologies for online energy marketplaces, is one of several companies p=
roviding products and services in this arena.  Recently, eyeforenergy conta=
cted Jay Sherry, vice president of global marketing, to discuss hybrid busi=
ness models and approaches and the issues that face those trying to impleme=
nt them.  Hybrid approaches to conducting e-commerce transactions online ar=
e rapidly finding a home in the retail energy space.  Such approaches are n=
ot being implemented for altruistic reasons; instead, for some, it's become=
 the means to survival.  Determining other uses for existing technological =
expertise... Click here for Full Story      FOCUS   E-procurement- is it so=
 much more than buying and selling goods and services online?   E-procureme=
nt involves companies buying their supplies online. As B2B e-commerce has b=
ecome the next big thing in the corporate world. The chief beneficiaries of=
 this trend are a growing list of software vendors, like Ariba and WebMetho=
ds, which provide applications that enable electronic procurement and also =
create Web-based trading communities.  In recent years, many Internet comme=
rce procurement application offerings have come to market addressing the au=
tomation and economics of the procurement process. Service companies have b=
egun to implement e-procurement applications and consult around the entire =
e-procurement process. Outsourcers... Click here for Full Story     Fuel Ce=
ll and Microturbine Roundup   The energy wires have been humming this past =
week with word of new and exciting technologies from the world of distribut=
ed generation, fuel cells, microturbines, solar photovoltaic and wind. Word=
 of increased rolling brownouts and power interruptions in the west and pre=
ssure from environmental groups concerned over co2 emissions are shining th=
e light on renewable energy sources as the world gears up to make sure the =
stream of power continues unabated.  With the dot-com meltdown in full swin=
g venture capitalists in search of the "next big thing," are casting their =
eye on the energy sector. If you listen carefully you will be able to hear =
the words of an old song drifting on the wind, "Welcome back my friends to =
the show that never ends, we're so... Click here for Full Story      INSIGH=
T   Energy Opportunities in the Asia Pacific Region   With e-commerce in th=
e Asia sector poised to explode, reaching 28 percent of the world's total b=
y 2005, it's small wonder that the region has a firm eye on energy. B2B Int=
ernet commerce in the Asia/Pacific region (including Japan) reached US 96.8=
 billion in 2000 or 22 percent of the worldwide total of US $433.3 billion.=
  The Asia Pacific region has enjoyed a rapid economic expansion in recent =
decades with a corresponding demand for electricity. This has placed a seve=
re strain on the ability of individual economies in the area to expand thei=
