[IMAGE]=09 [IMAGE]     Dear Jeffrey Skilling,   This year, more than ever, =
Thanksgiving means family, tradition,  and the celebration of this uniquely=
 American holiday. Cherished  memories and a slice of nostalgia touch the v=
ery heart of our  festivities. For you or a loved one far away, we've assem=
bled  a grand Thanksgiving selection sure to speak of these warm, wonderful=
  holiday traditions.   Calyx & Corolla creates luxurious style with Thanks=
giving-inspired  touches. Couture  Cornucopia  (shown right) is a true tabl=
etop tradition set  to be a focal point in the holiday home. Our enchanting=
 moss-covered  cornucopia brims with autumn?s bounty.  Nothing is cherished=
 more than the feast upon the Thanksgiving  table. Celebrate your family me=
al with the added beauty of our  Harvest  Centerpiece . It?s an eye-catchin=
g collection of nuts,  leaves, branches and herbs designed to show from eve=
ry angle.  If adding ambience to the air is your desire than you?re  sure t=
o love our Harvest  Candle Ring , which symbolizes the cycle of the year an=
d the  bounty of the fields.  The fall flower of the moment, Red  Rover Mum=
s , is the emblematic floral choice this holiday.  With their dramatic shad=
es of rusty red streaked with gold your  guests will be impressed by this g=
lowing display. Not to be outshone,  our Sienna  Roses  are a fine consider=
ation for a traditional family gathering.  Afterall, the rose is the Nation=
al Floral emblem of the United  States of America.  At last, our Sale   pag=
e is now featuring limited-time holiday offerings & our  online Specials   =
make simply spectacular gifts.  Calyx  & Corolla   =09[IMAGE]=09
