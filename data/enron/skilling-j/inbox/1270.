Hi Jeff, 
I am a consultant working with Conoco (Downstream North America and Europe) - helping them reinvent their business through innovation. My clients are Jim Nokes, EVP and Rick Hamm in Europe. I would like to discuss with you the possibility of you speaking to a group of senior executives at Conoco UK, telling the Enron 'story' and how you've reinvented your business. Your presence would be a very inspiring to them and telling the story 'live' would help them develop the mindset they need to innovate new products, services and get into new markets.
I will give you a call tomorrow (Tuesday) to follow up on your level of interest or I can be reached on my mobile at +1.617.306.0599
Thank you for your consideration. 
Sincerely, 
Carl Kaestner
