MENT - (Special early morning session) Scott Ettien, Vice President and Tim=
 Moore, Senior Underwriter, NCM Americas. Price differentials aren't always=
 about time and location-- sometimes they are about the likelihood of being=
 paid. Utilities have traditionally finessed credit requirements by spreadi=
ng uncollectables among their customer base, and until recently, this was e=
nough to make the utilities themselves bulletproof credit risks. No more. U=
sing credit insurance and internal controls to manage the final frontier in=
 risk management. KEYNOTE ADDRESS   9:15 a.m. - THE NEW U.S. ENERGY POLICY =
