[IMAGE]=09 [IMAGE]     Dear Jeff Skilling,   The finer things in life are s=
ometimes green. Our modestly monochromatic  Fragrant  Eucalyptus Bouquet  (=
shown right) is a natural display of greenery  that shows true luxury has n=
othing to do with imposing grandeur.  Easy to arrange in our architectural =
glass vase, the bouquet can  be left to air-dry naturally for enjoyment ind=
efinitely in the  home or workplace, and has a unique fresh scent.   With i=
ts handcrafted, grass-covered pot, our Grass  and Grain Sculpture  is an un=
usual dried arrangement in a natural  palette of beiges and pale gray-green=
s. Perfectly suited for any  type of gift giving, it is an interesting way =
to add natural beauty  to a setting and best of all, it requires no care.  =
As the weather changes, you can surely add warmth to a special  occasion wi=
th our decisively different Strawflower Plant . Also known as Everlasting F=
lower or Paper  Daisy, our cheerful Strawflower plant will bloom for months=
. The  papery petals actually make a rustling sound as the flowers open!  T=
wo eclectic fall specials we are proud to showcase this October  are our Ob=
ake Anthuriums  and our majestic Protea   that create a much-admired tropic=
al look.   Please remember National Boss?s Day is Tuesday, October  16. We =
invite you to visit our Specials   page for ideal gift selections & our Sal=
e   page for limited-time offers.  Calyx  & Corolla   =09[IMAGE]=09
