I don't know if anyone else was planning on attending, but I thought I would forward this just in case.
 
Sorry,
Bill

The BMC Tour of Houston has been cancelled. 
Unfortunately, a large portion of the racers would be coming in from international countries and the Federal Aviation Association is not planning to clear international flights for US landing until after the weekend, leaving the bulk of the riders not in Houston at the time of the race.
The Tour committee will be meeting next week to decide if this race will be rescheduled. If the race is rescheduled, it will not be for many weeks to come. Please check our website www.bikebarntexas.com <http://www.bikebarntexas.com> for future details. We apologize for this inconvenience. Please feel free to email us with any questions. 
Thank you for your understanding.
