Here's your chance to be on the news tomorrow morning if that rings you bell!  Sorry for the short notice, but we just received this opportunity a few minutes ago.  Please respond ASAP only if you are planning to be there.  Thank you.

Amelia--It is at the Fox studio (4261 Southwest Freeway).  The segment is at
6:45 a.m., but the riders need to be at the studio at 6:15 a.m.  The riders
should wear biking gear (Enron jerseys would be adorable!) and bring their
bikes if possible.  Lanny Griffith will interview the riders after the
weather segment!  I am sorry this is so short notice!  Any help would be
great!

Please let me know if you have further questions.  Thanks!!!
