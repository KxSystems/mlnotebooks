Dear JEFFREY SKILLING:

We are writing to you (and the thousands of other Texas households who
have chosen NewPower as their new Retail Electric Provider) to keep
you informed on the latest developments in the Texas Electric Choice
Pilot program. There have been delays in implementing the Texas
Electric Choice Pilot program, but none of these delays are going to
ultimately prevent NewPower from using our energy expertise to deliver
savings on electricity to our customers.  Nor will they prevent your
local utility from providing the same reliable service.

Here is the latest information from the Public Utility Commission of
Texas (PUCT):

1.  After several delays, we are pleased to announce the Electric
Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) began processing switch requests
to NewPower on July 31, 2001.
2.  Unfortunately, the switch requests are being processed by
ERCOT at a much slower pace than originally promised.
3.  As a result, based on past experience, NewPower has been given
estimates that your actual switch date could take place anytime
between now and November 2001.

NewPower must comply with the revised ERCOT timetable.  We can't
supply you with electricity until ERCOT processes the switch request.
But here's what we can do:

1.  First and foremost, we want to assure you that we are
committed to providing the stability and value you were promised when
you signed up with NewPower for electricity supply... despite these
delays.
2.  As soon as your switch request is processed by ERCOT, we'll
send you a welcome letter notifying you that your service has been
switched to NewPower
3.  In the meantime, we are doing everything we can to encourage
ERCOT to process your switch request more quickly so that you can
receive the savings you expect from NewPower as soon as possible.

If you have any questions or concerns, please visit the Public Utility
Commission's website at
http://www.powertochoose.org
or call NewPower at 1-877-819-9817.


Regards,

Nick Utton
