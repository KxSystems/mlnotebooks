WHITE PAPER:
The Effective Energy Risk Management Program: Design and Implementation

CONTENTS

Foreword by Leslie Haines, Editor, Oil and Gas Investor and Joe Fisher,
Senior Editor, Energy Markets

Why To: Hedging Softens the Blow of Skyrocketing Energy Costs
By Jodi Wetsuki
In the first half of the year, it was next to impossible to pick up an
earnings statement that didn't list "rising energy costs" as a major
detriment to the business in question.

When To: Designing an Effective Energy Hedging Program
By R. Martin Chavez
As the derivatives markets have matured, an old debate continues to rage:
should corporations that are exposed to the price of energy hedge their
exposure?

How To: Putting Your Plan Into Action
By Raj Mahajan and Brett Holleman
This article provides guidance to those companies looking to implement an
energy risk management program.
