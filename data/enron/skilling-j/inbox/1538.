Dear Jeff,
 
Several months ago I sent you an E-mail describing  my personal situation in the EBS work force reduction.
You may recall that I relocated in March 2000 from  New York City. 
I left my job with AT&T of 18 years, sold my  home and moved my family to Houston with the promise of opportunity and growth  at EBS.
As we are both aware, due to decline in the  telecommunications industry, EBS had to release 20% of it's work force. I  harbor no ill feelings towards EBS or Enron because I realize this is an  industry wide problem.
I have been unsuccessful at gaining employment up  to this point. The severance package I received from EBS is running  out.
 
I guess I am asking you if there is anything  available in Enron corp for me? 
I am willing to pursue a career in a different  area. 
 
I am attaching my resume for your  review.
 
Any help you can provide would be greatly  appreciated.
 
Thank you,
 
Rob Picciotto
