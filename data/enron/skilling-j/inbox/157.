Dear Jeffrey K. Skilling:

In New York City, next Monday and Tuesday, May 14 and 15, you have an
unprecedented opportunity to discover tangible ways to maximize the value
of your company's intellectual property.  Learn how to

? Use your IP to increase stockholder value,
? Determine the value of your IP to outside markets,
? Assess your IP value against the costs to exploit it,
? Handle your IP without risk of infringement,
? Balance business priorities while preserving IP rights
? Turn today's IP challenges into tomorrow's profits.

For 75 years the American Management Association has been showing companies
how to adapt to changing business environments.  With this conference, we
do it again!  Register today and help your company find its hidden IP
wealth!  Call 1-800-262-9699 for details and to register.

Complex technological innovations coupled with a proliferation of
intellectual property rights have brought the rich potential of IP to the
forefront in corporations throughout the world.  Many have discovered
competitive advantage in their once-hidden IP assets.  This seminar
provides a practical framework for understanding the array of issues
surrounding intellectual property and how to turn that knowledge into
corporate profits.

Showing the way will be IP expert lawyers from New York's premier IP law
firm Fish & Neave.  Corporate executives, come and learn; Corporate
executives, send your in-house lawyers.  The cutting edge of intellectual
property law and strategy will be on display at this conference!

We look forward to seeing you at the IP Strategies to Enhance Corporate
Profitability conference in New York next week.
