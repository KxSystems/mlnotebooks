Center Developement at Beltway 8 and Clay Road

Robert , we have been asked by Henry Terech Jr. and Lance McCarthy of
Enron Property & Services Corp. to submit a proposal to construct on
behalf of Enron a 45,000 square foot service center along the Beltway 8
just south of Clay Road. Enron would purchase the land and finance the
project and we would take the lead role as Developement Manager and
assist Enron in the design, construction and developement of the
project. This is a piece of business that we want and we are uniquely
qualified to execute. As you know, we have developed over 1,000,000
square feet of new industrial and service center space in this immediate
area the last three years and can provide alot of value to Enron based
on our experience. We have submitted a preliminary budget and will
follow up with Henry and Lance next week with a formal proposal.

Please let me know your thoughts. Thanks.
