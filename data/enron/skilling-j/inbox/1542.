Harry Jim,

Yours in -kai-,

PS. You won't believe this and neither will Grumbles or Coburn, but I, Drow
Berry, have now played golf twice in a week's time, for the first time in my
life.  My game sucked as much as always but God did I have fun playing with
my sons.  Adam even gave me a new set of woods for Father's Day.  I said,
"What the hell are these for?"
