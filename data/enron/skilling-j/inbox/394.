Jeff
 
Thanks for taking  the time to speak with me today about the Xcelerator.  I enjoyed the chance  to hear your thoughts on the effort, and appreciated the opportunity to  speak with Greg as well.  (Through our discussion, it is clear why he  is a respected leader in the "mafia".)  Please feel free to contact me if  you wish to discuss the Xcelerator further.
 
Thanks  again.
 
Heath
