Hi there!  Just wanted to update you on the Alamo Challenge.  The ride is on October 13 & 14.  Bill Wilson, who is part of the Motorcycle Support Team, informed the club today that this may very well be the last Alamo Challenge ride.  The American Lung Association is thinking about revamping the ride with a new name and new route (nowhere near San Antonio).

REGISTRATION DEADLINE is October 1.  Please make sure to turn in your registration form along with your pledges to me before then.  This is a cycling club sponsored ride.  The Matching Gift form for your pledges can be found online now at http://home.enron.com/cr.  Matching Gift checks are cut on a quarterly basis, so get your form in before October 1 so that it can be cut on time.

JERSEYS
The American Lung Association has made some really nice jerseys for the ride this year.  You can view it at their website www.alamochallenge.com.  The jersey is going for $45, but ALA has cut the cycling club a deal and will let us have them for $35-$40.  Sizes are M - 4X.  They run bigger than the enron jerseys.  Please let me know if you're interested in purchasing a jersey.

PLEASE GET YOUR REGISTRATION FORM TO ME BY OCTOBER 1.
