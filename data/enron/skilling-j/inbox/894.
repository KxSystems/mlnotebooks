Yes, Elvis is still  alive and reading these pussy-ass messages. To the class of 76-so, where are  the freaking parties this weekend. You 76ers are still worms. Last year the  class of 75 held the only DORG recorded in University Park history; initiated  the firstest and onlyest EWogolin.com; manned a Beta tent with more people  than the class of 74, 75 & 76 combined; were banned from O'jedas for 1  year for just being us and still had room for cocktails at the Mules house on  Sunday morning. 
You guys are pathetic - No worse, you guys are geese.

At  Homecoming 2000, the BETA TENT had the biggest crowd by far.  Stay  connected and consider a future homecoming BETA reunion.  It's  incredible...forget the 20 years in between...everyone just seems to pick it  up right where they left off years ago.
