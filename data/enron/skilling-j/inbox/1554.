Hi Ken and Jeff,  

This email is being sent to let you know that my consulting contract with Enron has finally come to an end.  It has been a great experience to me to have been involved in the development of such successful international projects as, Puerto Quetzal in Guatemala in 1993, Batangas and Subic Bay in 1992/93 in the Philippines and Guam in 1996, all of which are still contributing to Enron's earnings.  The opportunities provided me during the first 26 years with Northern Natural Gas/Internorth, from which I retired in 1988, and the last 11 years as a consultant for Enron Development and Enron International have made me a better person and I thank you both for this.

I will continue to  be involved in consulting and development of both power and natural gas projects, although on a more limited basis, and only as an independent.

Should there be any need for my services or need to be contacted for any reason, I can be reached at:

Curly Baca & Associates, Inc.

Houston, TX 77056-7075

Good luck as you both lead Enron, the Greatest Company, into the future,  and once again, Thanks for the opportunity!!

With Best Regards,



Curly Baca
