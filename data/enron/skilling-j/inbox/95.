During a recent visit to the EBS Information Security
team, it was realized that during the EBS
"redeployment"  about 75% of their teams resources
were cut, and now with the recent attacks/breakin's on
Enron resources (Routers, servers, clients) are there
any plans to bring that team back up to full
staffing??  It's my understanding that this team had
identified various risks and vulnerabilities in the
past, however without the proper manpower how is EBS
going to ensure security is not overlooked and these
breakin's do not continue?
