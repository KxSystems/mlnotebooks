Jeff,
Thanks for being on the panel at the CEO Forum.  I really appreciated
getting to hear the Enron story and talk through the talent issues with you.
At my end, I am targeting my time to work with a few executive teams who are
looking to forge a consensus response to problematic issues around managing
for shareholder value, dealing with the "nasty bit," and managing context so
that it does not overtake core.  If I could ever be of use to you at Enron,
it would be a privilege.
Cheers,
Geoff
