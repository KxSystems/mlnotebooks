Hi  Jeff,

Today's market is tough and companies are constantly looking for ways to improve their bottom line.  As a result, many companies are taking advantage of a global IT outsourcing model.  Outsourcing allows companies to free up internal resources, cut development and IT costs by over 50%, and keep up with leading technologies.

So Why spend $7,500 to $15,000/month for Certified Microsoft/Sun Developers when you can get them for $2,500/month? We can offer you Microsoft or Sun-Certified junior to senior level software developers for $2,500/month/Developer.

Speed, flexibility, and round-the-clock productivity are the hallmarks of Izhuta's Software Development Outsourcing Services. Our fast and flexible on/off site, offshore 24x7 delivery model lends itself to a full spectrum of outsourcing services - from applications maintenance, development, and modernization to full technology outsourcing, including data center operations.

We are a ISO 9001 Certified outsourcing company. Our cost effective software development packages include

. Microsoft or Sun-Certified junior to senior level software developers for $2,500/month/Developer
. Software Development for $18 per hour/Developer
. A team of 10 for $25,000 which includes a dedicated Engagement Manager and a VOIP Facility right from your office.
