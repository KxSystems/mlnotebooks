Drow,
When I opened your email, I figured you'd clear the confusion about
membership order in the upper 400's since you have access to the Gamma Omega
registry.  And being the ex-Pres you know the official ruling on pledge
order.  But then I realized "waaiit a minute, Drow won't give a flying ef
about that,
he'll probably hang someone instead."  Nailed it. Hung the Okies, lyin' old
bastards, the Exxon queen, and mopped us all with the homo sobriquet in less
than 100 words.   Still on top of your game. So, now that you got the
revenue machine rolling again, do we have to pay you for short stories or
are you going drag your sorry, tired ass up to the PC every night and keep
us entertained regularly for free?  I think we all know the answer to that
one, 'cause I used to be the Treasurer for these homos and they only paid
enough to keep Elzie and brothers awash in beer. Hell, we were so strapped
we had to tape the stolen McDonalds flag over the broken window in the Beta
house shower to keep from freezing our sacks.  Sorry the retirement ended,
but you gotta love that new revenue.  Stay in touch, bro.
