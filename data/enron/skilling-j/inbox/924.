Brothers, 
It has come to my  attention that either our YahooGroup is not working, 
or you are not  communicating.  So this message is a Search for 
ExtraTerrestial  Intelligence among the select Betas that make up this 
august group. I will  even count terrestial intelligence this time.
What with Homecoming only  5 days away, we figured there would be some 
message traffic on  eWooglin.
Hit reply when you see this message to let me know if there  is life 
out there.

At  Homecoming 2000, the BETA TENT had the biggest crowd by far.  Stay  connected and consider a future homecoming BETA reunion.  It's  incredible...forget the 20 years in between...everyone just seems to pick it  up right where they left off years ago.
