Howdy,
 
Thought I'd give my new scanner a try and also send you a copy of an article I wrote in Turkish for a magazine with which Ismail is involved.  Supposedly, I will be writing a page long article every month.  Two so far.  The idea is that even though my Turkish is flawed, it is good enough to communicate the impressions of a foreigner and presumably do so in a rawer, more authentic fashion.  Who knows?  But at least its good practice and approximates the process of writing in English.  
 
Can you let me know whether you were able to see the article?
 
Fondly,
 
Mark
