To get to the Star Fleet Marina from Houston:  Take I-45 South and exit at the League City Exit (#23).  Turn Left under the Freeway onto FM 518.  After 3 miles, FM 518 will veer to the Right. DO NOT turn right.  Continue straight onto FM 2094. Go approximately 4 miles.  Turn Left onto Carolyn Street (100' before FM 2094 dead ends into HWY 146).  Carolyn Street veers left, then becomes Grove Road and dead ends into the marina. I hope you choose to join us for this fun event.
