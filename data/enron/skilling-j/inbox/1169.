Dear friends and colleagues,

All Europeans have been following the horrific events taking place in the US over the last few days and we are all extremely shocked by this tragedy.
We would like to extend our deepest sympathy to all Americans and sincerely hope that none of you (or relatives/friends/colleagues) has been terribly impacted by these events.
We are also very comforted when seeing American's determination, strength and confidence in the future.

Sophia Antipolis - September 11, 2001

Net-atHome2001: an invaluable opportunity

A lot happened during this supposed quiet summer period...
Things are going so well that almost no sponsorship opportunities remain after Siemens, HomeRF, DS2, Wrap/Merloni, Konnex and MetaVector Technologies recently joined the pool of event sponsors.
Space at the exhibition is selling out fast and the highly interactive strategic conference is set to be the event of the year in Europe for all industry professionals (<http://www.net-athome.com/menu7.htm>): the event has already attracted enormous interest from the market leaders in this sector and 3 months prior to the beginning of this exceptional week, over 110 people already signed-up.
In November, over 300 attendees are expected to come for what will undoubtedly be the largest event in the field of Home Networks & Gateways, Connected Appliances and Internet Services in Europe.

Thank you for the time you have taken to go through this message. Please do not hesitate to contact us for any further information you would need.

Register now and sleep soundly?
For those who did not register yet, please note that facing the fast-growing success of the event, we have only a few hotel rooms left to offer to non partner attendees. It is thus obvious that the quicker you will register the greater your chances to benefit from two free nights at the M?ridien Hotel will be. Register now and save money to visit Nice !
