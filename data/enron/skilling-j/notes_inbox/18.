Dear Jeff,

Congratulations on your promotion!  I'm sure you already know how well 
everyone in the ranks is receiving the news.  You and Enron are truly amazing.

I really want to thank you, again, for helping me get involved.  It continues 
to be an exhilarating experience, and it has meant a lot to me personally for 
a number of reasons.  If I can ever help you in any way, just say the word!

Warmest personal regards,
Vince
