A police officer pulls a guy over for speeding and has the following  
exchange:
Officer:
May I see your driver's  license?
Driver:
I don't have one. I had it suspended when I got my  5th DUI.
Officer:
May I see the owner's card for this  vehicle?
Driver:
It's not my car. I stole it.
Officer:
The  car is stolen?
Driver:
That's right. But come to think of it, I think  I saw the owner's card
in the glove box when I was putting my gun in  there.
Officer:
There's a gun in the glove box?
Driver:
Yes  sir. That's where I put it after I shot and killed the woman who
owns this  car and stuffed her in the trunk.
Officer:
There's a BODY in the  TRUNK?!?!?
Driver:
Yes, sir.
Hearing this, the officer  immediately called his captain. The car was
quickly surrounded by police, and  the captain approached the driver
to handle the tense  situation:
Captain:
Sir, can I see your  license?
Driver:
Sure. Here it is.
It was  valid.
Captain:
Who's car is this?
Driver:
It's mine,  officer. Here's the owner' card.
The driver owned the  car.
Captain:
Could you slowly open your glove box so I can see if  there's a gun 
in it?
Driver:
Yes, sir, but there's no gun in it.
Sure  enough, there was nothing in the glove box.
Captain:
Would you mind  opening your trunk? I was told you said there's body in it.
Driver:
No  problem.
Trunk is opened; no body.
Captain:
I don't understand  it. The officer who stopped you said you told him you
didn't have a license,  stole the car, had a gun in the glove box, and that
there was a dead body in  the trunk.
Driver:
Yeah, I'll bet the liar told you I was speeding,  too!
