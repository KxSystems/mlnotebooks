Hi Jeff:

Survived my trip back and a week alone with the kiddies while Nina was out
at her conference in Corsica.  Just got notified that the first film I sent
off to shutterfly is available.  There are some really great photos from the
wedding day.  I'm sending you the link (by separate email)  if you're
interested and will make copies of the likely photos for you and rebecca
once I've gotten all the rolls processed.  If you see any in particular that
you like, let me know and I'll get copies made of those too.  (There's a
really good one of the two of you with Shukran!)

I really enjoyed hanging out with both of you and am looking forward to
seeing you one of these days in SF.  I don't have rebecca's email.  Please
sent her my love.

All the best!
