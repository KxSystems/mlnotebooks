If you decide to use this in press materials, please use the following 
verbiage in reference to Red Herring: 

"Presenting the most important private and public companies in the world: 
companies that, despite the downturn, are either disrupting existing markets 
or creating new ones altogether. Each year since 1997, Red Herring editors 
select 100 public and private companies they see as the brightest stars in 
the business universe: the companies whose products, services, and business 
models define business innovation. The Red Herring 100 represents the future 
- the latest trends, the hottest sectors, the leading markets. It predicts 
the definitive companies, the leaders of tomorrow." 

Again, we congratulate you and wish you success in your company's future 
endeavors. 
Sincerely, 


Red Herring Edit Staff
