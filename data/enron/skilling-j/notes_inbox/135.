Without knowing what subcommittees you are going to set up for the exec. 
committee members, I'll take the Analyst/Associate program.  We've been 
incredibly successful with Wharton/Penn , and I'd like to replicate our 
approach company wide.  I'm convinced with my help, we can do a world class 
job.  I'd be happy to give my thoughts on off cycle hiring, and other ways to 
improve the entire process (internal and external) around Enron.  

Thanks.   

Jeff
