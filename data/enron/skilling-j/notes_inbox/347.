Hello Jeff,

I hope you are well.
Below is a background on our firm.  As you will see what characterizes our
candidates
is their current or recent experiences.  Many have already rolled out into
industry as well.

Hawkes-Peers & Co. is an executive search firm based in NYC, specializing in
identifying opportunities for top-tier consultants from the top strategy
firms-McKinsey,  Bain, BCG, AT Kearney, and Booz Allen, who are looking to
move into the corporate sector.  These candidates also share the common
qualification of an MBA from one of the elite business schools such as
Harvard, Wharton, Sloan, Kellogg, etc.  Our focus targets this network of
individuals on an ongoing basis, keeping an active portfolio of these
management consultants from which we can draw for appropriate opportunities.

The emergence, growth, and continued vitality of Hawkes-Peers are a direct
result of the increased demand for strategy consulting professionals
throughout the United States.  Our intent is to identify and re-position
only those professionals who will enhance and build quality organizations;
and to adhere to high professional and ethical standards that serve the best
interests of our clients and our profession.

Our extensive network can allow your organization to be highly selective and
save you invaluable time.  We can give you the ability to select amongst the
most talented strategic, operations, and management consulting
professionals; and build strength in the future of your company.

If you have an interest in the pool of talent that we represent, I would be
more than happy to provide you with more information.  Additionally, I can
send samples of our past introductions as well as resumes provided with
permission from the candidate.

Sincerely,


Georgette Semaan
