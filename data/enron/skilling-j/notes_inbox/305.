IDC's Flagship Event:
 The European IT Forum 2001 - 11th Edition
 Grimaldi Forum, Monaco, 17 and 18 September
 "Old and New Worlds Collide in Europe: Will Business Take the Leap?


 Dear Mr. Skilling,

 Business  leaders,  market  players  and media representatives who attend 
IDC's
 European  IT  Forum  each  year  rate it the most prestigious and 
authoritative
 eBusiness conference in Europe.

 Past  speakers  at our Forum have included global business leaders such as 
Bill
 Gates,  Larry  Ellison,  Scott McNealy, Tim Koogle, Michael Capellas, Sir 
Peter
 Bonfield;  Economists  and  Technology  Gurus  Nicholas Negroponte, Gary 
Hamel,
 Jeremy  Rifkin,  George  Gilder,  Geoffrey Moore; Venture Capitalists, 
Bankers,
 eBusiness Stars and the most senior IDC analysts.

 Although  we  are  still  several  months  away  from this year's event, we 
are
 pleased  to  confirm the participation of the following industry leaders: 
Carly
 Fiorina  (CEO  of  HP),  Michael  Capellas  (CEO of Compaq), Jeff Bezos (CEO 
of
 Amazon.com),  Joe  Tucci (CEO of EMC) and the "gurus" Gary Hamel, Lester 
Thurow
 and Michael Porter.

 The key themes this year will be:

 -   the Internet stock crash and current economic slowdown
 -   how Internet technologies can help overcome the present financial 
downturn
 -   how the economy of established companies and the new order of dot-coms 
are
 merging
 -   how companies can formulate winning strategies by combining the Internet
 with traditional competitive advantages
 -   how Europe can take advantage of current favorable market conditions to
 catch-up with the US
 -   how investments in Internet infrastructures and eCommerce will drive a
 major economic development worldwide over the next decade

 We  would  be  honoured  if  you  would  accept our invitation to speak at 
this
 important event during the breakout session entitled: "eBusiness Strategies 
for
 Brick & Mortars"that will take place on Monday 17 September at 16.00-17.30.

 We  anticipate  a  select audience of CEOs and board-level delegates as well 
as
 columnists  from  key  European publications, as well as TV and other 
broadcast
 media.

 We hope that you can accept our invitation to present your vision of the 
future
 of the internet economy at IDC's European IT Forum.

 I look forward to hearing from you soon.

 Best regards,


 Roberto Masiero
 President IDC EMEA
