Jeff,

The information below is for 1959 graduates.  I think that you mentioned that 
we were looking for a male, which would make Bill's maiden name question 
irrelevant.  Let me know if you find the person.  Like I mentioned earlier, I 
have another idea worth considering if this doesn't work.

Take care,
Billy

Billy,

Attached is the additional data.

The names are the current names.  If he is looking for a woman, I would have
to also ask for "original" name as well but this may not be necessary.  Let
me know if you can determine the sex.

I look forward to meeting you when you come to town and no you really don't
have to buy me lunch.  This is really a fun place to work.........

Bill
