> Dear Jeff,
>
> Although I don't think we've met each other in person, we've been together
> in McKinsey for at least several years. I joined the Firm in 86 and left
> in 98 to become EVP at Endesa. Since then, we have had sporadic contacts
> with your people at this side of the Atlactic, specifically with Marc
> Frevert and Eric Gonzales.
>
> As you may know, we are right now in the process of merging with
> Iberdrola, the second Spanish electric company. If the merger is
> successful, we will be  "reinventing ourselves", as we will divest close
> to $15b of Spanish electric assets and reinvest the proceedings in new
> businesses and geographies.
>
> Last week, I discussed with Rafael Miranda, my boss and Endesa CEO, our
> interest to develop a formal contact with his counterpart at Enron, and I
> suggested him that I would contact you in that  respect. If the interest
> exists also on your part, please let me know.
>
> As a reference, I am attaching you the presentation we have been using
> with investors and analysts in our more recent roadshow.
>
> I hope to meet you in person soon. Warmest regards.
