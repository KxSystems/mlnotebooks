Jeff,  how was the bike trek to Austin?  Hope you raised LOTS of $$$.  Great
job you are doing!  My MS get together is next weekend (May 13th).

Homecoming 2000-be there!  Elvis is having a party for all Beta's (big 25th
reunion) on Friday night at his house.  The new stadium is supposed to be
awesome.  Hope you can make it.

Keep in touch,

-kai-

Chuck
