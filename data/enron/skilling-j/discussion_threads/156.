To quote Johnny Thunders "All Dressed Up.... I got nowhere to go".  If
anyone wanted the definition of "Window Dressing" just pull out the charts
on Friday's trading.  Money managers don't want to look bad at the end of
the Quarter so -  bid the stock up at the close to inflate your portfolio.
In the last 30 minutes the Nasdaq gained 60 of its 88 points; the Dow
Industrials gained over 100 points to close up almost 50 and ditto for the
S&P 500 which gained 14 points to close up 12.... As the million share "buy
at close" orders flowed, volume boomed and stocks lifted. (GE, which closed
up 2 5/8, had three million shares to buy on the close).  In Tech - CSCO,

up 15, VRTS* up over 7... TMPW* up over 8... SIRI+ up over 2 pre-launch,
