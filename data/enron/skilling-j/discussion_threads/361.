 Verliant, Inc.
  <<...>>
 Corporations today are confronted with a myriad of laws and
regulations from Federal, State and Local governments. Complying with these
regulations costs companies billions of dollars annually, in direct
compliance costs alone.   Furthermore, the risk of non-compliance is
significant and costs companies both directly, in terms of fines and
litigation, and indirectly in terms of increased insurance premiums.  OSHA,
which is only one of several compliance categories, estimates that companies
spend over $67 million annually--in fines alone.   Litigation and settlement
can cost multiples of the government fines.  Verliant has developed a
web-based, artificial intelligence tool that helps companies maintain
regulatory compliance and successfully manage operational risks. The initial
product focuses on compliance in environmental, health, safety and training.
The technology is developed and has completed a successful beta test with
its first client, Allied Waste Corporation. Contracts have been signed with
initial revenues to occur in January 2001.

 Technology & Product
  * U.S. employers face a multitude of onerous record
keeping and compliance responsibilities. The administrative burden of
maintaining up to date knowledge of, and complying with, regulatory
requirements is significant.
  * Verliant automates key management compliance
processes that were previously ignored or handled manually by employers' HR,
Safety or Legal departments.  Employers recognize significant cost savings
in compliance and substantial decreases in non-compliance.  Likewise,
productivity and the effectiveness of safety programs are enhanced.
  * Applications modules include: Human Resources
(Employee Record Management); Healthcare Compliance Auditing; Medical
Surveillance; Substance Abuse Program Tracking; Training, Evaluation and
Endorsement Tracking; DOT Driver Qualification File Maintenance; Event
Management; Accident and Injury Reporting, Tracking and Analysis; and
Industrial Hygiene.

 Market
  * There are over 6.5 million American firms that must
comply with regulatory standards.
  * OSHA estimates annual compliance costs at $33
billion.

 Marketing Strategy
  * Initial focus will be through direct sales to
Fortune 2000 companies.
  * Pricing is based on a monthly fee of about $2 per
employee.
  * Verliant has signed contracts with Allied Waste and
San-i-Pak.
  * The company plans to implement multi-tiered, direct
sales, distribution model supplemented by resellers with substantial
existing presence within niche target markets.  The company is negotiating
agreements with several resellers in both the medical and waste management
industries.

 Competition
  * Verliant has identified two direct competitors. The
first is Medgate, a privately held Canadian company that offers several
competing modules, but is not yet internet-based. The second is Complient,
which is in development of an internet-based compliance solution,
supplemented by training and safety product sales.
  * Other companies such as J.J. Keller, a privately
held company focused on the Department of Transportation (DOT) solution
only, is not internet-based.
  * A more distant competitor is PureSafety.com, which
focuses only on OSHA Training Tools.
  * Verliant is developing strategic relationships and
marketing alliances with several companies in the medical, waste management,
and PEO industries.

skills, domain expertise, market knowledge, distribution channels,

document imaging, or full-service data entry and date loading.

algorithms, and flexible reporting functions.

strategy will be based upon building brand awareness by virtue of its
expertise and the founder's reputation in the occupational health and safety
industry.
