On Thursday neither the Dow Industrials or the Nasdaq saw green... what was
particularly surprising was there was an expectation that end of month widow
dressing would carry us up for the close of the week - maybe this bodes well
for Friday - if there is any action expect it in the morning as traders
leave early for a long holiday weekend. (Tues. is the July 4th holiday and
Monday is a short trading day). In tech generally - UIS tumbled over 30% on
negative talk going forward and numerous downgrades, CPQ* (Compaq Comp) down
over 11% on analyst comments, EMC (EMC Corp), IBM ORCL (Oracle) all down 2%,
AFCI (Advanced Fibre Communications) ERICY (LM Erics Tel) and NSM (National
Semiconductor) down 6%, GTW (Gateway) SAP (Sap Aktiengecell) and ADI (Analog
Devices) all down roughly 5%, TXN (Texas Instruments) down 4%, NOK (Nokia)
and HWP (Hewlett-Packard) down 3%.... there were a couple of bright spots -
COMS (3-Com) up 9% on earnings, INTU (Intuit) up 7% and FON (Sprint Fon GP)
up over 3 1/2% - bouncing back from yesterday.... another stock of note
yesterday LLY (Eli Lily) up over 15 due to positive reports on new drug.....
In the CEUT Universe: INIT* (Interliant) and ITWO* (I2 Technologies) both up
over 3, NATI* (National Instruments0 down over 5, AMCC* (AMC Corp) up 4,
PSEM* (Pericom Semiconductors) and CNXT* (Conexant Systems) down 3, SSTI*
(Silicon Storage) down over 2 1/2, JDSU* (JDS Uniphase) down over 5, BRCD*
(Brocade Communications) up over 3 1/2, PRCM* (Procom Technologies) and
NTAP* (Network Appliance) both down over 4, PROX (Proxim) and RIMM*
(Research In Motion) down nearly 4 (RIMM* continued to tumble in after hours
trading after they came in inline but there were negative rumblings on the
call), NUHC* (Nu Horizons) down over 1, MERQ* (Mercury Interactive) up 2,
MUSE* (Micromuse) up over 6 (continuing rise), VTRS* (Veritas Software) down
over 9, TMPW* (TMP Worldwide) down over 3, DISH* (Echostar Communication) up
over 2, GILTF* (Gilat Satellite) down 3, GMH (General Motors H) up 3 (on the
rebound), SPOT* (Panam Sat) down over 3, WCII* (Winstar Communications) down
over 2 1/2, COVD* (Covad Communications) down over 1. In IPOland some were
up strong, some weren't - Capstone Turbine (CPST) tripled after coming at
the top of the upward range - the company makes parts for power generators
and electronic vehicles.... Accord Networks (ACCD) - the Israeli realtime
interaction co. closed down 19%.... Virage (VRGE) - video content dist.
