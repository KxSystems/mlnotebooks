Hi, Jeff.? I wanted to send you my "business  card", not having one Friday 
night when my friends and I met you at the  Federalist in Boston.? I no 
longer work for Governor Cellucci and have a  real estate investment 
management company of my own. (see below)
?
To remind you, I am a BU alumna, having graduated  from the Graduate School 
of Management.? If your daughter thinks she might  like to attend BU and you 
need a database of alumni, I would be happy to meet  with her for a future 
reference. 
?
I would be remiss, however, if I did not mention my  alma mater undergraduate 
school, Simmons College.? It's located in the  Fenway and is the only women's 
college in Boston.? The college is noted for  training women to be leaders in 
diverse fields, from communications (my  undergraduate degree), to health 
care, to management, to name only a few  majors.?We have quite a number of 
notable women executives, media  celebrities, and lawyers, like myself, 
too!What's nice about Simmons is that it  combines the best of higher 
education worlds; i.e., it is a small liberal arts  university for women with 
a co-ed social life. ?Simmons is one of 32  other colleges in Boston and was 
ranked 15th among all colleges in the Northeast  by US News last year.? 
?
If I sound as if I'm promoting Simmons, I am.?  The reason I left 
Massachusetts?government last year was to run the  College's 
Centennial....once in a hundred year opportunity, you know!? And,  besides, 
Gov. Cellucci's wife Jan received her graduate degree from Simmons in  
library science, so he was fine with my departure.? 
?
If you think Kristy might entertain a women's  college, the website is 
www.simmons.edu.? My friend Patricia  Tencza is the Undergraduate Admissions 
Director.? If you or your daughter  want to email her, just mention my name.? 
Her email address is Patricia.Tencza@simmons.edu.
?
I hope your trip back to Houston was  fine.?? I enjoyed meeting you.? Wish we 
had a bit more time to  talk.? Regards,? Maria
