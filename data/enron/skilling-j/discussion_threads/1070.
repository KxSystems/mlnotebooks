Jeff,


John Blaisdell had forwarded you a term sheet last week on Photofete.  I
have attached a second draft which incorporates a few changes based on
conversations I had with Mark Hughes at Thompson Knight and Jennifer Binder.
Please give me a call if you have any comments on the term sheet.  I have
advised Mark that we will not begin the drafting process until we have heard
back from him that the terms are acceptable.
