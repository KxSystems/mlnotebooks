Jeffrey,

I tried sending this to you on Monday but had gotten an email rejection 
message from your email server? With summer time here, I hope you get some 
vacation in and that all is well with you and your associates. Permit me to 
again update you from our end:

TREND

At Noble Systems, we continue to expand and with an increasing number of new 
customers whose organizations had previously used some other predictive 
dialer but have now switched to us. One such new installation has just 
reported a net 20% increase in performance by switching to ATOMS.

REVAMPED WEBSITE

Noblesys.com has been totally revamped and with several new items added! 
Also, it is now a lot easier to navigate.  Please check it out!

In addition, under 'News' we've posted the announcement of our email ACD 
Module e_ATOMS ERMS (Email Response Management System) and our collaborative 
browsing module  e_ATOMS "chat". Please let me know if you'd like additional 
product information.

You'll also see our new trademark and "Contact To The Nth Degree" advertising 
tag.

NEW FEATURE

Agent-specific messaging. When an answer machine is encountered, ATOMS can 
leave a standard message without the call ever going to agent. Now with some 
agent identifying code in the dialing record, these messages may now be 
'agent-specific': in the agents own voice: "Sorry I missed you. This is Dan 
Donaldson of Noble Systems calling about a wonderful opportunity. Please call 
me at 888-434-2537."

DYNAMIC CAMPAIGN BUILDER (DCB)

Dynamic Campaign Builder (DCB) has earned Best of Show at CT Expo in Los 
Angeles (Computer Telephony Magazine - April Issue - details ATOMS DCB).

Dynamic Campaign Builder (DCB) enables supervisors to create entirely new 
outbound, inbound and blended campaigns and with graphical looking agent 
screens including branched logical scripts using embedded variables - and all 
without needing a programmer!

Please advise if you'd like more information on DCB and/or our DCB User 
Manual, I'll be glad to get it to you.

PERFECTSCRIPT

PerfectScript (Patent pending) eliminates people immediately hanging up 
because they notice the 'predictive delay time' do not want to hear "another 
telemarketer". PerfectScript is now in demand because on all outbound calls 
it minimizes this 'predictive delay time' by always promptly responding to 
the answering 'hello' with a recording in the agents own voice e.g. "Hello, 
this is Jeffrey of Enron Capital & Trade Corporation, may I speak with". As 
the agent, you hear most of your pre-recorded voice segment and when it ends, 
you simply speak and ask for the person being called.

And very importantly, with PerfectScript, every call automatically starts 
very positive and upbeat!

Additionally, PerfectScript also allows agents to use at will other 
pre-recorded segments e.g. responses to questions, standard instructions, 
disclosures etc. throughout the day. The other party does not detect any 
voice segment as being pre-recorded because there are no clicks or beeps. 
Agents talk less but since they pre-record these segments also using very 
positive voice inflections, their presentations are also more effective and 
upbeat!

OTHER SIGNIFICANT FEATURES

Interactive Voice Response (IVR) type functionality - Very importantly, 
callers can now get retrieve their information and balances without ever 
going to a live agent. Callers can be prompted for touch tone entries which 
may be used for routing, additional menu selections and/or voice messages.

Advanced Skills-based Routing - In addition to intelligent call routing to 
designated agent groups based upon unlimited ANI/DNIS combinations, ATOMS 
also enables you to rate each agent's proficiency in each of an unlimited of 
categories that you define. ATOMS will connect each incoming call to the most 
proficient agent available for the categories previously identified within 
the customer record.

ATOMS has now been internationalized. Among other benefits, support for all 
time zones and international telephone numbers is now included.

Near toll quality 16:1 end-to-end voice compression for remote locations.

Complete fault tolerance (via clustering).

EXTENDED SUPPORT HOURS

Responding to our growing install base, we now actually staff our customer 
support center 24 hours a day Monday thru Friday and 22 hours on Saturday. 
Support access via pagers is now only from Saturday night at 10:00 PM to 
12:01 AM on Monday morning.

EXPANDED PRODUCT FLEXIBILITY

ATOMS is now also available in lower-priced inbound-only configurations 
and/or inbound-only upgrades.

Also, with many ATOMS features, customers need only purchase the number of 
concurrent seats actually required. For example, predictive licenses, Digital 
Recording (DRS) ports, PerfectScript DRS ports, Email ACD (ERMS) licenses 
etc. may be shared by many different agents at different times as long as the 
total number of agents using any feature at any time does not exceed the 
total number of licenses purchased.

Jeffrey, I do hope you have a great summer and that this update is helpful. 
Whenever I can be of help in any way, please do not hesitate to call.

Have a great week!
