Beta Brothers,
?
A collection of reunion pictures have been posted at EWooglin.com(aka:  
Egroups.com).? The link below should take you directly to the proper  page:
?
http://www.egroups.com/files/smu-betas/Pictures/
?
Check them out at your convenience.? While you're there, click  My Profile in 
the yellow band near the top of the page.?  In the next screen click Edit 
Profile, then enter your current  address, phone number, etc.? When you are 
done, be sure to click  Save Changes at the bottom of the page.
?
Another interesting area of our site is the Links page(see  the table of 
contents on the left hand side of the page).? There you'll  find some of our 
brothers' business web sites.? Just another?way to  become reacquainted with 
Beta brothers.? Feel free to suggest additional  web sites. 
?
Enjoy the pictures (more to follow) and don't forget to enter your address  
and phone number.
