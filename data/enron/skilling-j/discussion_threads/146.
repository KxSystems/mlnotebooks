We're in the middle of the Fed's two day meeting and Tues.'s trading
reflected a degree of nervousness. Everyone is positive that the Fed isn't
going to raise - right? Buyers seemed to be following Prince Hal's adage -
"Discretion is the better part of valor". People sat on the sidelines and
watched Tech fall on it's own weight - there were some buyers - CVS (CVS
Drugstores), WMT (Wal Mart) and HD (Home Depot Inc) up over 5%; RDA (Readers
Digest), ETH (Ethan Allen) and GPS (Gap Inc) over 7% - not exactly cutting
edge names. But Tues trading seemed to scorn anything next generation - HLIT
(Harmonic) down over 40% (after neg pre-announce) AFCI (Advanced Fiber
Comm.) down 16%, WMB (Williams Communications) down 13%, RHAT (Red Hat Inc)
and NSM (National Semiconductor) down 7%, PAIR (Pairgain Technologies) and
ADCT (ADC Telecomm) down 6%, TXN (Texas Instruments) and IBM down 4%
(negative analyst comments on IBM), GLW (Corning Inc), HON (Honeywell
International), INTC (Intel Corp) and SUNW (Sun Microsystems) all down 2% or
more.... some of the laggards of late were in the green - YHOO (Yahoo) and
INKT (Inktomi)both up over 4% but the real feel of the day was reflected in
the Nasdaq (down 50), the Dow Industrials (down 38) and the S&P (down 4.55).
Down - not "panic" down but a "treading water" down. In the CEUT Universe -
AMZN* (Amazon) up over 7%, CTAC* (1800 Contacts) continuing its climb up
over 1, LLL* (L-3 Communications) up 3 (shaking off unfounded talk as
William Kidd said it should), GOAM* (Goamerica) up 8%, PROX* (Proxim) up
almost 2, JBL* (Jabil Circuit) up 1 3/4, BMCS* (BMC Software) up over 1 1/2
- but these were the bright spots in a overall down day - BWAY* (Breakaway
Solutions) down 1 7/8, ITWO* (I2 Technologies) down over 3 1/2, LU* (Lucent
Technologies) down 2, JDSU* (JDS Uniphase) down over 6, ANCR* (Ancor
Communications) down 3, PMCS* (PMC Sierra) down over 5, SSTI* (Silicon
Storage) down over 14, RIMM* (Research In Motion) down over 10 (following
Jason Tsai's downgrade), MUSE* (Micromuse) down over 6, VRTS* (Veritas
Software) down 4, TMPW* (TMP Worlwide) down over 3, ICIX (Intermedia
Communications) down over 2.......... In IPOland - BUSY (Busybox.com)
(images over net) up over 10%, EFDS broke issue bid but closed even, STLW
(Stratos (Lightwave) up over 60%, CKCM (Click Commerce) up over 75% and the
star of the day - MRVL (Marvell Technologies) up over 270% - a flashback to
the last century.  Coming Wed. - Genuity (GENU) - net infrast. to ISPs -
