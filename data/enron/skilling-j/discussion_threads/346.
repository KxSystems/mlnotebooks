Jeff,

Thank you again for your time yesterday.  I know you are very busy and I 
appreciate your support in writing me a recommendation for HBS.  If I can 
provide you with any additional information, please don't hesitate to call.

FYI: the HBS application deadline is January 5.

Best Regards,

Bruce
