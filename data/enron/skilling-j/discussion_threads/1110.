Have received the architects signature on the above however, we still need 
the following items: 

Borrowers signature on the 3 page draw request and the Contractors 
Disbursement Disclosure and change order #24. 
We were also advising on the last application because he is now holding only 
5% retainage he would be providing us with an all bill paid affidavit with 
each draw request.

Please forward. 

Thanks!
