Tom,

From previous notes, which I bcc'd to you, looks like I'm "in business".

I've really appreciated your two recent e-mails (as I have all of them).
Had gone to the Tribune web site (something I'd done before, in order to
show my friends here your picture, and brag a bit) looking for info on
percepctive section, but probably due to my bad searches didn't unearth it.
You explanation was very important.  Also important were your comments on
what struck you about what I've been writing.  Those kind of comments are
the best kind.  Often, when writing, its hard to know what works and what
doesn't work.

Perhaps the most important thing, however, is that the article will be
published by "Tom Skilling's" brother.  Though nothing's been published yet,
and I shouldn't write as if that's a certainty (afraid of bad luck), would
never had gotten close to this opportunity without you.  I'm very grateful.

Love you and looking forward to both of us experiencing how this ol'
newspaper media machine works (something with which I guess you are all to
familiar).

Mark-O
