How kind of you and Enron to think about employees like myself who have lost 
a beloved family member and who are having a hard time during this holiday 
season.  Dr. Williams' session below was very helpful, and I ran into 3 
fellow employees that I work  with that I didn't even know were going through 
a similar situation.  Thank you very much.

Happy Holidays to you and yours.
