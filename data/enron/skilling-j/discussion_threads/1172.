Background:

As you well know, over the last 9 months EBS has made substantial efforts to 
establish a significant commercial relationship with AT&T.  Thus far, there 
have been no transactions between EBS and AT&T other than a couple dozen of 
circuit purchases by us mostly local loop.  Previously, our primary senior 
point of contact with AT&T has been Frank Ianna (President of Network 
Services).  It is probable that Ianna brought only the typical legacy 
perspective which prevented him from seeing how we could facilitate the AT&T 
business from a wholesale relationship.  They seemed to only want to sell us 
services.

Adventis advises us that Ianna now reports to David Dorman and that Dorman 
should be able to better understand the value that EBS can bring to further 
his business objectives.  It is my understanding that it will only be Dorman 
at the meeting (he is supposedly not bringing Ianna).  I view this meeting as 
a worthwhile shot to see if it is worth pursuing AT&T at all for the balance 
of the year for a big transaction.  Dorman's positive receptability to us is 
the only reason I can see to spend significant resources on AT&T in the near 
future.


EBS - AT&T History

Jun 2000 EES sponsored Executive Briefing with focus on EES and EBS - 
attendants include Frank Ianna from AT&T.

Oct 2000 - Extensive EBS team meets with extensive AT&T team to set up eight 
tactical and strategic working teams to find opportunities for the   
companies to build a bilateral commercial relationship.  After three weeks, 
results were presented to executive committee of both teams. Nothing 
materializes.

Potential Opportunities

AT&T currently spends a significant amount each year (expected to be in the 
$100s of millions) on offnet services (wholesale expenses) .  EBS would like 
AT&T to allocate a potion of the purchases towards EBS.

Adventis states there are currently numerous major undertakings by AT&T which 
are transforming the telecommunications operations at AT&T.  Is there not 
something EBS could do to help advance these undertakings?

At a minimum we would like AT&T to interconnect to our pooling points.


Final Note

I do not think we should lead with trading.  We should lead with our ability 
to provide services to the wholesale sector of the industry. The typical 
reaction we get from incumbent players is that if they don't trade or if they 
think that trading puts downward pressure on prices, then they should not do 
business with Enron.  They need to understand that they don't need to trade 
to have a valuable business relationship with  Enron
