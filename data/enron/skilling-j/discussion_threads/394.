Dear Jeff,  Many congratulations on your promotion to CEO.  We are proud of 
all the tremendous progress Enron has made under your leadership so far and I 
am confident you will continue the progressive leadership of the company in 
your expanded role.  I wish you personally the very best and wish you the 
spiritual support to lead Enron to new heights of serving our global 
community.

God bless,

Rick
