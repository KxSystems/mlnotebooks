Point of clarification.  SWBT board will have six regularily scheduled
meeting next year.  They will be held on the 4th Wednesday of  January,
April, May, July, October and November.  10:00 am - 1:00 pm.

If you join us, I will make every effort to get rid of the africa painting
in the board room.

While you are considering this I just wanted to be sure you had the right
dates.

If I do not see you before then, Merry Christmas!
