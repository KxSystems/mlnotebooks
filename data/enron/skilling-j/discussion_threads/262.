Jeff,
Below are the comments from our inspector regarding the  current draw in the 
amount of $180M +/-.
?
It may  be that some of the hardware is off site and hasn't been installed as 
of the  inspection date. I'm sure Jeff can address this.
?
Call  if any questions.

Have  received inspection on the above and have noted the  following:
?
Interior hardware installed ($20,308.47 line item, drawing $20,308.47)  Only 
50% completed, drawer glides and door hinges are all that is  done.
?
We are  also still waiting for the signatures on the 3 page draw & the 
Contractors  Disbursement Disclosure and change order #20.
?
Thanks!
