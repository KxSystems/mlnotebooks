While visiting India on vacation, I met with, 

Mr. N. R. Chanda
General Manger
Power Grid Corp.
Northern Region-1, H.Q., 
S.C.O. 84-85, Sector-16
Faridabad 121002, India
Phone 91-292990

who would like to talk to Enron about setting up power trading in India. As 
India is moving towards de-regulation, he thinks this is the right time to 
start the process. He has high opinion of Enron. He would like a write-up 
about setting up power trading. So that he can discuss this further with 
other officials. I would be happy to work on this project and help Enron 
start power trading in India. Thanks.
