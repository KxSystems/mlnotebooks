Tom,

Thanks again fro your thoughtful notes.

Can't say life normal, but in areas without damage not to far away from it.
Plenty of food.  No hoarding.  Delivery trucks seem to be bringing in normal
loads on a daily basis, just like before.  Of course, things will be taxed
by the demands of the rescue and restoration, but looks like the suffering
will be for those who were injured or who lost loved ones.  And what a lot
of suffering that will be.  Do have access to my building.  It is on solid
ground and is older, which in Turkey ironically means safer.  Still, spent
two of the last three nights sleeping outside, with millions of others.
Again, my buddy Ismail keeps coming through for me (Sukran too) and have
been able to enjoy his and his friends' company.  On these nights, every
open space not too close to a building seems to be filled with people
sleeping on blankets, jackets, etc.  Some have strung string between things
trees and other things you can tie string too and with sheets made
relatively cozy little spots for themselves.  It continues to amaze me how
kind and caring Turks are and how safe it is here (though I did hear of one
poor old fellow got his shoes stolen; perhaps he simply absent mindely
misplaced them).  Everyone, though, is tramatized, tired and sad.  And what
you read about impact on attempts to get economy, which has been hit hard by
Russian crisis, going unfortuantely appear right on the mark.  Wish Turkey
all the luck in the world.  It will need it.

Able to watch the local news, though obviously don't understand a lot of
what they're saying.  Still, the pictures tell enough.

More later.  Nice to know you're thinking about me.  Let dad and mom know
not taking any chances that weren't there already.

Love,

Mark
