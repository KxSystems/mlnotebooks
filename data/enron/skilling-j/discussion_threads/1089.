Greetings, Tom!  Have you recovered from the whirlwind of the inauguration?  
Wasn't that fun!

I'm writing in the hopes you can provide a little background for a cover 
story that Worth Magazine is doing on Jeff - he's traveling and it's 
difficult to reach him, hence my note to you.

The report is interested in the station call letters and channel number in 
Aurora, IL, where Jeff worked in high school.  Additionally, he would like to 
confirm that Jeff started out as a camera man and graduated to producer.  Is 
this the correct history?  Any historical information you can provide is most 
appreciated.

I hope all is well.  Look foward to hearing from you soon.

Regards,
Sherri Sera
