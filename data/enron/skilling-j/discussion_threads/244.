Hello,

I've added you to my smu-betas group at eGroups, a free,
easy-to-use email group service. As a member of this group, you
may send messages to the entire group using just one email address:
smu-betas@egroups.com. eGroups also makes it easy to
store photos and files, coordinate events, and more.

Here's a description of the group:
------------------------------------------------------------------------

With the assistance of Brother Shackleton, E.Wooglin.com has become a 
reality.  This site will serve as a data base for SMU Betas to facilitate 
planning and the organizing of reunions.  All the information members provide 
the data base will be available to other members of our group as well.  This 
should be helpful as we plan to travel and wish to visit brothers when we're 
in the neighborhood.

Here's my introductory message for you:
