Jeff (Rocky) Skilling is not able to attend the football game, but he 
appreciates you offering to get him a ticket.  He will, however, be at Elvis' 
party Friday night.

Subject: Last call for tickets


Various Beta Buttheads,
   OK, the deadline is fast approaching.  We're inside two minutes to play
and I need to know the game plan.  As of this day Oct. 2, here's what I have
confirmed in tickets ordered so that we all may sit together at this year's
homecoming game:
Mannino/1, Beek/1, Jordan/1, Artie/1, Wallace/1, Elvis/2, Grumbles/2,
Glass/3, Chuckles/1, J. Miller/2, Shack/1, Space/8 (he's bringing all of
Elzie's living relatives), Hutch/2, Fullerton/2, Coburn/2, Jansson/5 (he's
bringing all of Mom Pinchbeck's living relatives), Rossell/2, and Carl
Hohl/2 (he thinks...not sure because he never was).
    Now, if there are ANY OTHERS, you have about 48 hours because I need to
order these things when I get back in town on the 5th.  So if any of you
reading this want some, give me an email.  Also think about recruiting
others not on my email list that you think might not yet know about all
these plans.
     WE ARE ABSOLUTELY GOING TO ROCK THE NEW STADIUM.  I've already
contacted officer Caffey and he's given us yet another reprieve to behave
any damned way we want to, complete with SMU Secuity protection.


Yours in -kai-
Dro
