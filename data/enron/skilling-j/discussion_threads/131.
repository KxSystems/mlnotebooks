The attached draft memo announcing the new stock option plan has been 
prepared and approved by HR and Legal.  We would like to send this by email 
to employees on Wednesday, June 28, and have hard copies translated and 
available for employees in outlying areas the same day.  In order to 
distribute this on Wednesday, we'd like your approval or comments by 10 a.m. 
Monday, June 26.

Thank you.
Karen
