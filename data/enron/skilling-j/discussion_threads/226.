Dear Sherri, or Rocky, or Jeff, or Elzie, or whomever,
    Tell his Enroness, Lord Rocky that his confirmation of his appearance at
Elvis' party Friday nite is "gate", that his regrets towards attending the
football game on Saturday is "beek", and that we really don't care if he
shows up or not really, as long as he sends his "gate, bar, goddess"
girlfriend he had with him at Miller's wedding and we'll all be just happy
as a piece of dog liver in our mouths.
     Make SURE he sees this message on his very large desk or we will invoke
the Eye of Wooglin upon him.

Yours in -kai-,
Drow
