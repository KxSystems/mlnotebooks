Erica, thanks for the note.  Joannie has left the office for the day, but 
will return tomorrow morning.  

In the meantime, I'll run this by Jeff to see if he thinks it makes sense.  
Do you have any dates for future dinners in mind?  The vast majority of 
Jeff's time is committed through February 2002, so knowing what the 
dates/timeframes are would be most helpful in the event we need to try to 
free up some time.  Thank you.

Regards,

Probably the best thing is for the call to go ahead, that way Jerry can
brief Mr. Skilling on our plans for the remaining dinners throughout the
year and Mr. Skilling can decide on the best one for him to attend.

Does that sound feasible to you?
Erica

Erica, Jeff is currently scheduled to be on vacation July 19.  Would it be
possible to schedule during the next quarter?

Thanks,
Joannie

Dear Mr. Skilling:

I write on behalf of Jerry Murdock, who is currently in Europe.  Mr.
Murdock
asked me to pass on the following information regarding your telephone call
scheduled for 10:00am (CST) on Tuesday, May 15.

Insight Capital hosts a quarterly dinner with Robert Rubin and Steve
Friedman and other selected guests.  Our next dinner is scheduled for July
19 and will be held in Aspen, Colorado.  The Current State of the Global
Market will be one of the topics under discussion and Jack Welch of GE is
one of your fellow invitees.

The purpose of your conversation with Mr. Murdock is to discuss the above
in
more detail and to more fully brief you on the purpose of these dinners.

Please do not hesitate to contact me should you require any further
information.
