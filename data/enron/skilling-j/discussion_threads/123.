Hello, Mr. Skilling! Enron and MDA are joining together again to do a 2nd 
Annual Beach Bowl to raise money for MDA. Last year, the event was a great 
success, raising over $70,000.  This year's goal is to raise $100,000, so the 
fundraising benchmarks for all teams have been raised. The money raised will 
be used to further research for ALS (Lou Gehrig's Disease).

I have put together a team of Analyst interns for a second year to help in 
this cause.  The benchmark for the team is the raise $600 (pre-matching), but 
I want to outdo the fundraising of $1400+ (post-matching) we did last year.

I am asking for a donation to MDA to help our team bowl in this event.  
Checks are payable to MDA.

FYI, Enron matches all donations $20 or more. 

The event will take place on Saturday, July 29, 2000.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks! Have a great day!
