Per his request, we weren't able to video Gary Hamel's presentation at the 
Management Conference.  However, he was kind enough though to send along his 
PowerPoint presentation -- I understand that he doesn't typically do this.  I 
thought you would like to have it for your files. 

Take care,

Hello Terrie,

I understand you were hoping to get a copy of Gary Hamel's Powerpoint slide
presentation.  It is attached.

Our apologies that it took so long!

Best to you,
