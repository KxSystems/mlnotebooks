Dear Mr. Blumberg,

On behalf of Jeff Skilling, I'm writing to let you know that he will be
traveling on Thursday, December 14, and will be unable to take your call as

Further, Mr. Philippe Bibi, Enron Chief Technology Officer, is the
appropriate person to contact within Enron regarding your products.  I have
forwarded this information to Mr. Bibi, and you may contact him directly.
His e-mail address is philippe.a.bibi@enron.com.

"Ajunto is the Enron of IT Sourcing..." ---  Mike Carter, CEO & Founder,
Ajunto, December 12,  2000

"Skilling notes that  skeptics thought Enron was crazy when it dared to
make  electronic
?markets in energy. His confidence comes  down to his belief in Enron's
market-making model.
?"We have a better business model.  It's a fundamentally better business
model," he repeats.
?Some $200 billion in trading  activity on an E-commerce site that's less
than a year old speaks
?volumes about Enron's  ability to mobilize and execute on whatever it puts
its mind  to-however
?the company decides to describe  itself."
InformationWeek,  11/6/00

"As head of two Enron  pipeline subsidiaries, Mike McConnell knew a lot
more about gas flows
?than he did about data flows last year  when he got a surprise call from
Enron President and
?Chief Operating Officer Jeff  Skilling. Recalls McConnell, "Jeff went into
this whole  thought
?process about how the Internet is changing  everything. He said, 'We need
to make Enron
?an e-business, and I need a guy that can  run this as a business. We need
to change the way
?we view technology.'?? "I thought he was a little crazy and I  said,
'Jeff, I'm not a technology person
?at all,? ?'He  said, 'No, seriously -- this is going to be big.' So I took
over as CEO of  Enron Global
?Technology," and thus became the company's  de facto CIO, McConnell
explains.
