Enron Corp
Jeffrey Skilling


Dear Jeffrey,

I'm writing in regards to your online strategy and in particular how you plan 
to build and scale your emerging online business and relationships.  
E-Business Relationships can mean a lot of things.  At it's core, it is 
understanding the needs of your customers, partners, and employees 
(collectively, your Business Community), and getting the right content to the 
right person to generate the greatest impact in the most timely and effective 
manner possible.

Strong e-Relationships increase retention rates, conversion rates and drive 
long term loyalty.  The idea is to make the internet your Business 
Communities' preferred channel for completing a transaction that is being 
offered, whether that is completing a support call, buying a product, 
registering for an event or service, enabling partner success, managing an 
account, training, or just acquiring information.

As Enron Corp looks ahead, it is important to continue to better understand 
who your Business Community are and in turn build online relationships with 
them.  Studies have shown that companies spend five times more on attracting 
new customers than on retaining the customers they have.  Attracting new 
employees can cost 10 times more than retaining existing employees, and in 
the energy business your reputation with your partners is critical to your 
success.
