Karen, thank you for the update.  Please note in future communcations that 
"McKinzie" is actually spelled "McKinsey."  As Jeff worked there prior to 
coming to Enron, this is a typo he would notice.  I have changed it in the 
copy of this message given to him.  SRS

Subject: Harvard Update

Leonel Azuela (Harvard) verbally DECLINED our offer to become an Associate at 
Enron.  He will accept a position with McKinzie in Houston.  He said he 
really appreciated the calls and the follow up especially from Jeff Skilling 
and he wants to keep in touch since he will be in Houston.  Leonel said that 
due to his financial situation, he really had no choice but to accept the 
McKinzie offer at this time.  Other than that, he admires and respects Enron 
and thought we did a top notch job with our follow up. He really envied the 
opportunities we had to offer.  It was truly a monetary issue.

BUT... It's not over, we still have 4 outstanding offers for HBS that expire 
on February 15th.  Please call the candidates and offer your assistance in 
answering any questions about the organization or Houston in general that may 
help them with their decision.  

The candidates are:      
     David Frost   617-562-1872
     Scott Landry   617-661-8499
     Amy VanBuskirk 617-868-1816
     Antonio Vivanco  617-868-9008 

I spoke to everyone last week and I know that a few want more time.  For 
example, some candidates are doing very targeted searches that are outside of 
the campus recruiting process.  Unfortunately, we cannot extend our 
deadline.  I honestly think we have a chance with these candidates.  It is 
important to emphasize the opportunities at Enron because most of them have 
other offers that exceed our package, but if they look at the BIGGER PACKAGE, 
we are very much a contender.  It's our job to sell them on that long term 
opportunity and to look beyond the short term.

Thanks for your help.

Karen Marshall
Recruiting Manager
