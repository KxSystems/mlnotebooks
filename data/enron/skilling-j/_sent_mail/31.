Subject: Enron Online Bid/Ask spread question

Hello Jeff, 

I submitted a  question that didn't get answered at the meeting.  I was 
hoping you could respond.  

We routinely see citizens of a country hold an "inferior" currency despite 
the presence of superior alternatives.  The incumbent currency has a smaller 
bid/ask spread, and a network externality  locks-in  the inferior currency.  
Volume creates lower spreads and lower spreads in turn attract more volume, 
conferring a monopoly status on the incumbent currency.

Do you think that Enron Online is taking advantage of a similar network 
externality?  How do our bid/ask spreads compare to the alternatives 
available to our competitors?  Do we stand willing to match our competitors 
bid/offer?

A final note:  I was curious to learn what you did to become so successful.  
Is there a place where your biography or resume is posted?  

Thanks in advance,

David Porter.
