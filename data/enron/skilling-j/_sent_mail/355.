Jeff:
In the March 2001 article of ecompany you recently made a statement about
what " Keep's
executives up at night?"  You were quoted:  "  Keeping the system up.  You
dread the chance
the system will crash.  We had an air-conditioning problem last April or
May, and we went down.
The next day the front page of Gas Daily Journal had a story that said, '
gas trading stops because
EnronOnline is down.'

I work with Availant, a software company in Cambridge, MA and our product,
Availant Manager, is
"self healing" technology.  It is proactive and autocorrective, designed to
monitor key system
resources and to take safe and effective action on an event before an outage
ever occurs. Recently,
Compaq decided to ship our software with every new Proliant server it
delivers to its customers.
It is brand-named Compaq Availability Agents.

We believe our software could be of great value to Enron as the operation of
your online business is
so dependant on continuous server uptime.   If you would, please let me know
via email or phone the most
convenient way in which to schedule a meeting with the team who runs your
server operations.  I can be
reached directly at 617-374-7969.

Thanks,
Rob
