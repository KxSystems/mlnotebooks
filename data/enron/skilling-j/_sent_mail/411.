Subject: CERA's Mexico Energy in Transition Summit




Mr. Jeffrey K. Skilling 
President and COO 
Enron Corporation 

Dear Mr. Skilling: 

Building on the success of our special event held this past August in 
Houston, Cambridge Energy Research Associates (CERA) has created a new 
service, the "Mexico Energy Advisory Service". Designed to help facilitate 
the dialogue between the energy community and key government decision-makers, 
this service creates an open environment for members to exchange ideas with 
the country's energy policy makers regarding the future of the Mexican energy 
sector and the role of private investment.

To launch this new service, we will be hosting the inaugural Mexico Energy 
Summit on January 17, 2001 in Mexico City at the JW Marriott Hotel. This 
event will bring together senior executives from the energy community as well 
as key members of the new Mexican government in interactive sessions aimed at 
facilitating dialogue between the public and private sectors.

We invite you to consider participating in this first Summit, and becoming a 
member of the service. To view the agenda for the first Summit meeting, as 
well as a description of the scope, benefits, and deliverables of the 
service, please visit our website at: 
http://www20.cera.com/event/details/0,1324,CID1287,00.html 

The goal of the Mexico Energy Advisory Service is to help bridge the 
information gap that now exists in Mexico's energy sector. Through our 
interactions with the private sector, the state owned energy companies, the 
new administration, the Congress, and other interested parties, CERA will 
formulate objective and independent market analysis, and will monitor the 
progress and pitfalls of the energy reform process in Mexico.

To view the complete details of the service, please visit our website at:

To participate in the Summit, please complete and return the enrollment form 
found on our website. Please note that a portion of the Summit fee may be 
applied toward your first year's membership in the service. Should you have 
any questions about the Mexico Energy Advisory Service or the Summit meeting, 
please contact me or my colleague Lauren Laidlaw.? I can be reached directly 
at +1 617 498-9191 or e-mail to abullrich@cera.com.? Ms. Laidlaw can be
