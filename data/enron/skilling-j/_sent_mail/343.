Judy, my apologies for the delay in responding to your request.  The meetin=
g=20
is scheduled to take place at Enron Broadband Services facility located at=
=20
727 N. Shepherd Drive.  I have attached a map for your file.  There are no=
=20
hotels in that area, but hotels located downtown are approximately 15 minut=
es=20
away by taxi or car.  I would suggest the DoubleTree Allen Center=20
(713.759.0202), the Downtown Hyatt Regency (713.654.1234), or the Four=20
Seasons Hotel (713.650.1300).  Should you have any problems securing a room=
,=20
please let me know.  I'll be contacting you and the other speakers within t=
he=20
next week to arrange a conference call.  In the meantime, please let me kno=
w=20
if you have any other questions.  Regards, Sherri
