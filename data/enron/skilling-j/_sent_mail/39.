Patti, can you believe that out of all those dates you offered that Jeff is 
only available on October 14?!  I have penciled it in on his calendar as has 
Rebecca.  We'll look forward to more details.  Thanks, and have a wonderful 
time in Cabo!  I'm so envious!!!  Sherri

this a trial run for a potential, more revealing  spread??
