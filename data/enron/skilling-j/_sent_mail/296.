The Stanford Business School, in collaboration with the management-consulting 
firm McKinsey & Company, is conducting a large study of global corporations, 
their management practices, and organization.  Enron is participating in the 
project in order to learn how our own practices and activities compare to 
those of other leading global firms and to see which bring true benefits in 
the global marketplace.  One of the unique features of the project is that it 
seeks to assess the knowledge and communication networks within a company by 
asking employees throughout the company to comment on their actual practices 
and experience.  The goal is to obtain real and accurate information by 
surveying the people most directly involved in the company's operations. 

I would like to ask you to help us in getting the most out of our 
participation in the GLOBE Initiative by completing the GLOBE Network 
Survey.  The survey is brief and should take no longer than 15 or 20 
minutes.  Your responses will be treated as strictly confidential, and will 
be used solely by the Stanford/McKinsey researchers to evaluate how specific 
practices and structures impact global communication and knowledge flows.  If 
you would like individual feedback on how your own networks compare to those 
of others in the study, please check the appropriate box at the end of the 
survey.  

Please save this email for future reference and, again, thank you for 
contributing to this important learning opportunity.
