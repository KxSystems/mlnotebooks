Jeff,

As the new year rolls around, many executives we work with choose to
re-evaluate their personal financial matters and in some cases, make changes
where appropriate.  Accordingly, I am writing to arrange a brief visit
around the 1st of the year to evaluate your current situation and see how
Goldman Sachs might be helpful to you.

Can I phone Katherine to arrange this brief meeting with you?

Sincerely,
