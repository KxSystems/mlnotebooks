Ron, 

Your e-mail was such a pleasant surprise!  Thanks so much for the kind words.

I would love to get together for lunch in the near future, though January is 
typically a tough month for me.  I'll have my assistant, Sherri Sera, call 
your office to see what we can arrange.

Thanks again for the note.  I look forward to seeing you soon.

Jeff
