Subject: Hey Big Guys!

Oh Awesome Ones!  How grateful we are for your phenomenal fundraising efforts 
for Team Enron!  
Below is the rider number which you will wear in 2001, based on your 
fundraising performance in 2000.  

I will have your "special" rider packet at all our pickup points described in 
my earlier notice.  I am picking these up for you on March 20, and if you 
would prefer to pick it up yourself at one of the MS packet pickups, please 
let me know before Tuesday, March 20, at Noon.  I don't want to have it here 
at Enron if you're expecting to find it somewhere else!

Also, if you know for sure you will not participate this year, please let me 
know that ASAP! (713-646-6569) 

We will miss Wendy Gramm skating with us this year.  She has a date conflict 
but will return next year.  
Amy Moore is not riding this year, but is in charge of our refreshment tent 
in Austin!

Very impressive list, and thanks for all the hard work.  Team Enron has 50 of 
the top 200.
