Stan,

Per Jeff's request, I have forwarded the resume you attached to Philippe 
Bibi, President & CEO of Enron NetWorks.

Jeff would be interested in a tour of the building.  Would if the afternoon 
of May 8, at 3:30 would work for your schedule.  At Jeff's request, I plan on 
including Bill Donovan.

Thanks,
Joannie

Jeff,

How's it going in the world of energy?  I enjoy reading about you and your
adventures. Sounds like you might be having a little fun as well.

Attached is a resume from an acquaintance of mine.  Nice guy and would be
credit to anyone's organization.  Thought you  might forward it to
personnel.

Don't forget you've got a lifetime warranty on the drywall in your house.
My compliments.  Call me if you have any problems.  Also I walked your new
building last week.  Quite impressive, especially what we're having to
build on a tight schedule.  Should really be nice.  If you'd like a
personal tour, let me know.  I'd love to put you in a hardhat and introduce
you to the team that's doing all the work.  Would make a great shot for my
in-house publication and maybe yours as well.

Miss seeing you at our Forum meetings.  WPO is not as much fun as YPO.
Enjoy it while you can!

-Stan

Hi Stan:

It was good to meet you this morning. I've enjoyed working out with Joel;
he's a good "kid" and I can certainly relate to his Midwest roots and Iowa
State background. I grew up on a grain/livestock farm in Gladbrook, Iowa, a
town of under 1,000 people, and did my BS at Iowa State and MBA at Kansas
University.

I'm currently working as Director, Business Development at RedMeteor.com,
an
internet-based energy brokerage company. We compete against Altra Energy,
EnronOnline, InterContinentalExchange and HoustonStreet. We started with
$22
million in venture capital, but need an additional infusion of capital to
build out our business model. I think it's going to be difficult for us to
attract additional funding in this climate, so I'm interested in making a
move to another employer when I find the right fit.

As I mentioned this morning, I've been talking with Conoco recently (my
previous employer for 9 years) as well as Enron's Broadband Services group.
I'm looking for a Houston-based business development position that would
build on my eCommerce experience at RedMeteor or my oil & gas pipeline
operations background. I've also met with Reliant Energy recently although
I
understand they've suspended hiring in their trading/eCommerce groups due
to
the California crisis.

Any suggestions you would have would be appreciated. Thanks for your time.
