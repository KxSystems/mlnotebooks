Dear Jeff,

Today is my last official day at Enron. It has truly been a great 
professional experience working at Enron.  
Particularly memorable has been the opportunity to work with some of the most 
talented people ever gathered in one organization.

Should a need arise in the future where my skills and experience can make a 
difference, please do not hesitate to contact me.

With Best Regards,

Don Reid
