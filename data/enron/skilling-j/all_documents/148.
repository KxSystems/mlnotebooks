Dear Mr. Skilling,

I would like to begin by stating that I love working for Enron and would=20
never even dream of working for any other company.  However, after reading =
an=20
announcement made about the storage trading initiative on the Bloomberg=20
website I was a little disturbed.  This is an idea I have been trying to=20
forward since October and presented it to Mr. David Cox (EBS) back in=20
November or December.  Mr. Cox liked the idea and pulled me from Enron Glob=
al=20
Technology to Enron Corporate Reserach under Mr. Kaminski as an Analyst to=
=20
help with other, EBS, initiatives while I developed this idea. =20
Unfortunately, no one seemed to be interested in pursuing this opportunity=
=20
till now; however, it seems to me that we are now interested in pursuing th=
is=20
and therefore I would like to ask that I be given an opportunity to fully=
=20
pursue and develop it.  I am attaching a small presentation that I had=20
developed to present to Mr. Dimichele=01,s group.  In this presentation you=
 will=20
see that I am not only looking at storage as a traded commodity but several=
=20
other features of the Internet that will be traded in the future.  The reas=
on=20
I am bothering you with this is because I only saw your name mentioned in t=
he=20
Bloomberg report.  Please let me know how you would like me to proceed with=
=20
this.  Please consider this e-mail confidential.  Thank you.
