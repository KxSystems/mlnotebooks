Sawhill.  I am taking the liberty of forwarding them to colleagues who

John.  Best, Les

Les,

We had a Memorial Service for Nature Conservancy staff and board last week
in
conjunction with our board meeting.  I had the opportunity to say some
words
about John.  I thought you might be interested in seeing them.

Keep in touch,

Mike Coda
