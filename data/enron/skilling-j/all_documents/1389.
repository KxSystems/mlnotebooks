Hi gang!  This is not the weekly training schedule note - just wanted those 
of you who are riding the Tour de Cypress this weekend to know that Stephanie 
Strong will not be picking up your rider packets as she did for the 
Bluebonnet.  She wants to be at the Enron MS150 packet pickup at the Big-E 
Cafe on Friday.

If you haven't yet registered for the Tour de Cypress, you can get more 
information at http://www.bicycletexas.com/houston.htm. 

More later.......
