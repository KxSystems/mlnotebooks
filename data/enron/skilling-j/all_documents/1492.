Dear Mr. Skilling,

 My name is Chris Weekley and I am David and Bonnie Weekley=01,s son.   I a=
m
writing because I am in search of a summer internship (paid or non-paid).  =
I
recently had out of town plans fall through and this is why I am beginning
this process seemingly late.  I am a junior at Vanderbilt University and I =
am
majoring in Human and Organization Development with a focus on Leadership
Effectiveness.  This major studies organizations and the human interactions
that allow them to effectively operate.  I have taken various courses in
organizational theory, economics and human relations.   I think it would be=
 a
great opportunity for me to gain experience within Enron.  I would be more
than happy with any type of job from research to customer relations.  For t=
he
first three weeks of summer I will be a counselor at a Christian sports cam=
p
leaving me available from June 11th until August 8th.  I am trying to tie
something down in the next few days prior to my departure for camp if at al=
l
possible.  Thank you so much for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Chris Weekley
