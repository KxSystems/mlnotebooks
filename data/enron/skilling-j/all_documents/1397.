Christie, do Sherri or I need to do anything to send the survey from Jeff's 
e-mail?

Thanks,
Joannie

Subject: Stanford/McKinsey survey invitation letter

Jeff and Sherri,

As Jeff and I descussed briefly on the Dallas trip, Enron is involved ina 
5-yr research relationship sponsored by Stanford, in conjunction with 
McKinsey entitled "GLOBE"--it's looking at how Global companies manage 
themselves, internal communication networks, etc.

Part of the yearly plan is to conduct an emplyee survey of approximately 100 
"global" employees. I've taken the survey myself--it takes less than 15 
minutes--it's very easy and doesn't require revealing anything sensitive we'd 
be concerned about. Clicking on the invitation letter will provide a direct 
link to the survey, so please feel free to review the survey itself, or even 
take it.

We can best benefit from the data gathered if we get a good return on our 
survey.  We're likely to have the best chance of a good return if the 
invitation letter to participate comes from Jeff.

Would you please read the attached letter? If you give it your consent and 
approval, we can arrange to have the survey sent from Jeff's mailbox.



Please let me know--thanks!!

--Christie.

Hi Christie !!
 
  Please send me the survey invitation letter.  Also, I will send you a copy 
of the random list of respondents for your review tonight.  As I mentioned to 
Gerry, the survey is already developed and hosted by the Stanford/McKinsey 
group; therefore, there is no additional development work required.  
Typically, I would use our in-house survey tool, confirmit, to build and 
deploy surveys.  This is a special case where the survey link is already in 
place.  My specific deliverable for you would include the list of 100 random 
individuals and a mechanism for the deployment.  The same manner in which 
Gerry and I received the survey can be used for the 100 random individuals.  
That is, simply mailing the survey link along with the invitation letter to 
each individual via Lotus Notes.  This is not a typical function of my area; 
however, I am glad to lend assistance in this case.  

In the future, should you require a survey built from "scratch" 
(so-to-speak), I will be able to assist you in that process.  Thank you for 
your patience.

Regards,
Milton

Hi Milton and Gerry!!

I can prepare the survey invitation letter.  Shall I send it to both of you?  
When do you think we can expect to be ready to send the survey?

Thanks to both of you!
