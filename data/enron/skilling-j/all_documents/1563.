> An unemployed man goes to apply for a job with Microsoft as a janitor.
> The manager there arranges for him to take an aptitude test (Section:
> Floors, sweeping and cleaning).
> After the test, the manager says, "You will be employed at minimum
> wage, $5.15 an hour. Let me have your e-mail address, so that I can
> send you a
> form to complete and tell you where to report for work on your first day.
> Taken aback, the man protests that he has neither a computer nor an
> e-mail address. To this the MS manager replies, "Well, then, that means
> that
> you virtually don't exist and can therefore hardly expect to be employed.
> Stunned, the man leaves. Not knowing where to turn and having only $10 in
> his wallet, he decides to buy a 25 lb flat of tomatoes at the
> supermarket.
> Within less than 2 hours, he sells all the tomatoes individually at 100%
> profit.  Repeating the process several times more that day, he ends up
> with
> almost $100 before going to sleep that night.  And thus it dawns on him
> that
> he could quite easily make a living selling tomatoes.
> Getting up early every day and going to bed late, he multiplies his
> profits
> quickly. After a short time he acquires a cart to transport several dozen
> boxes of tomatoes, only to have to trade it in again so that he can buy a
> pick-up truck to support his expanding business. By the end of the second
> year, he is the owner of a fleet of pick-up trucks and manages a staff of
> a
> hundred former unemployed people, all selling tomatoes.
> Planning for the future of his wife and children, he decides to buy some
> life insurance. Consulting with an insurance adviser, he picks an
> insurance
> plan to fit his new circumstances. At the end of the telephone
> conversation,
> the adviser asks him for his e-mail address in order to send the final
> documents electronically.
> When the man replies that he has no e-mail, the adviser is stunned,
> "What,
> you don't have e-mail? How on earth have you managed to amass such wealth
> without the Internet, e-mail and e-commerce? Just imagine where you would
> be
> now, if you had been connected to the internet from the very start!"
> After a moment of thought, the tomato millionaire replied, "Why, of
> course!
> I would be a floor cleaner at Microsoft!"
> Moral of this story:
> 1. The Internet, e-mail and e-commerce do not need to rule your life.
> 2. If you don't have e-mail, but work hard, you can still become a
> millionaire.
> 3. Seeing that you got this story via e-mail, you're probably closer to
> becoming a janitor than you are to becoming a millionaire. (Not you Jeff, I 
know it was printed for you!) 
> 4. If you do have a computer and e-mail, you have already been taken to
> the
> cleaners by Microsoft.
> 5. And God forbid if you own any
> Microsoft stock... better start selling
> tomatoes.
