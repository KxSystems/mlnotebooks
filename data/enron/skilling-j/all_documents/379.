Thanks for hosting the breakfast and for emphasizing the importance of the=
=20
PRC process to the success of Enron.  Prior to joining Enron, I worked at t=
wo=20
other companies in the mid-stream natural gas industry.  As I was listening=
=20
to you speak about the way Enron was in the pre-PRC days (the Hay system an=
d=20
the like), memories of some of my experiences in those organizations came=
=20
rushing back.  Although I had a number of important reasons for leaving tho=
se=20
companies, the key issue in both instances was the failure of their=20
performance review processes.

I share that information because I have seen both sides, the worst and now=
=20
the best.    As with most things, those who complain or criticize often do=
=20
not really understand or appreciate how good they have it.  Criticism is=20
often fostered by a lack of understanding - - people asking "why?" in a=20
destructive way.  The information you shared about the importance of the=20
program to Enron=01,s continued success and the points you made in response=
 to=20
some of the criticisms of the process were both very important.  I will tak=
e=20
your message and pass it along, however, I respectfully encourage you to do=
=20
likewise to all of Enron.  I know you have previously stressed the importan=
ce=20
of the process at numerous times and through a variety of modes of=20
communication, but this morning you really gave the all-important reasons W=
HY.

I appreciate being selected to be on the committee and look forward to=20
participating.  Thanks also your leadership, it's truly inspiring.  =20

Sincere regards,
Ed McMichael
