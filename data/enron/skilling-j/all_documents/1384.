Steven, thanks for the e-mail.  Per David Cox, EBS has been in discussions 
with Disney for quite some time.

Thanks,

Subject: Broadband partnership with Walt Disney Corp

Jeff,

Have we explored the possibility of a broadband partnership with the Disney 
Corporation? I watched an interview the other night with Michael Eisner, and 
he said several times during the interview that Broadband held the future for 
delivery of Disney's entertainment products, but Disney is still waiting for 
the broadband infrastructure and bandwidth to be developed.
