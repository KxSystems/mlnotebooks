Stan, Jeff will be travelling the biggest portion of May.  Would you let us 
know the next time Ali is in the US and I will try to work something out for 
them to meet.

Thanks,
Joannie

Jeff,

Happy Easter!

A few years ago at the YPO Harvard University, I met a guy from Venezuela.
He and I have kept in contact through the years and we get together from
time to time.  We had dinner a few days ago and he asked me if I thought
you might be interested in meeting with Ali Rodgrigues.  Ali will be in the
US sometimes in May and may be available to meet.  He and my buddy have
been friends for years and I thought I'd extend the offer.  I don't know if
there is an agenda or not.  Those guys are hard to read.  Just let me know
if it's something you want to do.  Otherwise I'll just forget about it.

Keep that stock going up!

-Stan
