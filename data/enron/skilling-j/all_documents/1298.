Jeffrey,

Congratulations on the Business Week cover; very nice.

Things going along at a dizzying clip here; I will be proposing to Sukran o=

Wednesday evening (our two year meeting anniversary)?at a great little, new=
ly=20
found (by me at least) restaurant in my neighborhood. I have hired a fasil=
=20
(classic Ottoman music) band to serenade us at our table, etc. If all goes=
=20
well (and there are lots of little hurdles to be leapt) looking at an early=
=20
June wedding. Yikes!=20

At the same time think I have found a fantastic place here on the Asian sid=
e=20
over looking the Bosphorus. Not a sure thing, as have to make sure to=20
minimize the many risks. But if it works out it=01,s a house for a lifetime=

dad, though will need to do that soon as well.

Say hey to Rebecca and the kids.

With love.
