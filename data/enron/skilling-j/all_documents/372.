It's my pleasure to attend -- I am looking forward to meeting you. 

I will fly in the evening before and try to catch up with Kevin Garland and 
Patrick Hickey. Perhaps if you are around we could meet for a drink.

Best regards, 

David

Subject: YPO Panel, April 24, 2001 

David, 

Many thanks for agreeing to speak at our YPO session on April 24, 2001, in 
Houston.? The meeting will be held at Enron Broadband Services' network 
equipment staging building, which is close to downtown.? We anticipate 
attendance of about 100 people. 

Breakfast will begin at 7:30 a.m., and the program will run from 8:15 a.m. 
to 10:15 a.m.? The subject is "New Trends in Technology and Venture 
Capital."? You will be on a panel discussion with two other venture 
capitalists.? I expect the tone will be highly informal, but I will 
schedule a conference call (probably in early March) to provide more 
details and specific topics of interest. 

Again, David, thank you.? I look forward to seeing you in April. 

Jeff
