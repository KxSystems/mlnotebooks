Jeff, this message is self explanatory.? Pat Arthur of our office is "in 
charge" of selling and setting up hospitality suites for companies in Texas 
and we have an opportunity for our firm and our firm's friends to sign up 
before he "goes public".? If Enron would be interested, let me know and I 
will make sure it is taken care of.

Regards, 

Mike Buttrey 

PS? thanks again for lunch.

The U.S. Open golf? tournament will be held at Southern Hills Country Club in 
Tulsa next June 11-17. 

With few exceptions the OPEN is never held this far south, thus making the 
event very accessible to those of us in the Dallas area. This will mark the 
3rd Open to be held at SHCC.

I've been asked to assist in the Corporate Hospitality for the event. Because 
of this it is possibly to offer to your clients an invitation to one of the 
world's preeminent sporting events. To see it live , to watch the drama 
unfold in person, is an unforgettable moment. This is one reason why 
companies want to secure a corporate hospitality package. Before I put the 
word out in the Dallas market (and they will sell out soon) I wanted clients 
of MHBT to have the first shot. (I think this is a fair privilage)

The tickets to the event are sold out already, so the only way to gain access 
is via a hospitality package. They aren't cheap but the chance to have a U.S. 
Open so close might never happen again. Prices are from? $28,500 to $150,000. 
These prices range from a table in a furnished, shared pavilion to an 
exclusive environment. 

If you have anyone you think might be interested please let me know and I 
will be happy to visit with them and describe all the amenities associated 
with each option. 

These started to go on sale in the Tulsa marketplace recently and several 
options are SOLD OUT, including a few over $ 500,000.

Since demand is so high and space is limited I will hold off a week before 
making non-MHBT clients aware of this opportunity of a lifetime.

Take advantage of getting your best clients into the 2001 U.S. Open. 

Pat
