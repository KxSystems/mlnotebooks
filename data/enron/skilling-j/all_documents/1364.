Subject: advanced arbitrage enabling technology out of Caltech




Jeff,
 

I'd like to introduce you to?our company?and set-up a?one-hourconference 
call?and discussion with you?and/or?someone you?trustto evaluate?this 
opportunity.

iSpheres Corporationisco-founded by the Chairman of  Computer Science 
Department at California Institute of Technology.

iSpheres enables dynamic arbitrage opportunities in commodities  trading. 
With iSpheres, trading firms wrap applications like steel  marketplaces, 
energy marketplaces, demand planning systems, and production  planning 
systems as components, and derive additional business value by  monitoring 
these components for real time interdependent events and then  reacting to 
those?composite events  based on business rules.

iSpheres provides a software framework for developing and deploying these  
loosely-coupled Web Services or Meta-Applications. These applications are  
assembled from multiple components, each of which was previously itself an  
application and data source, to enable new business processes. 



For example, a $22 billion investment bank uses the iSpheres Meta  
Application Framework,?to  detect and react to interdependent market events. 
This enables them to optimize  and automate the acquisition and response to 
relevant dynamic?events in  their Market Intelligence information 
environment. 

The build out of the Internet and the rapid  deployment of eBusiness 
applications over last several years has established the  need and created 
the ability to build and deploy loosely-coupled Web Services or  Meta 
Applications. 

Please advise, otherwise I'll  follow up with you in 3-5 days.
Thanks,

H. Enzo Olfati 
Account Manager

P.S.?I have also  e-mailed this to others at Enron?to determine the 
appropriate contacts  to?have the discussion  with.
