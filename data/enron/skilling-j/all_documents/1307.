I look forward to seeing you Thursday evening, February 15, at the Texas 
Public Policy Foundation ("TPPF") event, "A Farewell Evening with Lady 
Margaret Thatcher."  Wendy Gramm, who serves on our Board, is the Chairman of 
the Board of the TPPF.  The TPPF is a state research institute guided by the 
core principles of limited government, free enterprise, private property 
rights and individual responsibility.  TPPF is similar in many respects to 
the Heritage Foundation in Washington, D.C., but focuses on state issues.

Below are the pertinent details for the event.  Please call Rebecca Carter 
(x3-7241) or Sherri Sera (x3-5984) if you have any questions.
