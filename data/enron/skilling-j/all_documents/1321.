Dear Ms. Gallanter,

Jeff is traveling abroad this week, so I have taken the liberty of responding 
to your request in his absence.

Enron's board of directors meeting and annual shareholder meeting is 
scheduled to take place in Houston on Tuesday, May 1, making it impossible 
for Jeff to accept your invitation.

Subject: Pug Winokur Suggested I Contact You


Dear Jeff,

I just wrapped up a meeting with Pug Winokur, an Enron Board member, and he
suggested I contact you to invite you to participate in a CEO forum we host
called Build Value 2001 CEO Forum to be held on May 1, 2001 at the Fairmont
Hotel in San Francisco, California.  The Build Value 2001 forum is a
powerful venue to share your perspective and insights with CEOs of
high-growth technology companies intent on learning and sharing with one
another.  This year's conference is heavily focused on exploring the
opportunities and challenges in the converging online and offline
marketplaces, and perhaps no other firm understands how to be successful in
this market more than Enron.

The discussion we would like you to join is among CEOs and business leaders
who are in large organizations that have effectively stayed on top of the
wave and embracing technological innovation to succeed.  David Pottruck is
confirmed to speak on behalf of Schwab and we have invited AG Lafley from
P&G and Jeanne Jackson from Walmart to join the discussion.  Your
participation on behalf of Enron would clearly be an integral part of the
discussion.

Now in its fourth year, the Build Value CEO forum has established itself as
the premiere learning forum for business executives intent on building
successful technology related companies. The annual forum attracts a diverse
group (750+) of CEOs and technology leaders who are integral to the
continued growth and purpose of this learning community.  The Build Value
2001 CEO forum is not a typical two-day investor conference. Rather it seeks
to create a living lab of "how-to" success stories that can be referenced by
participants throughout the year. This content becomes a valuable guide for
many emerging growth companies and can be reviewed online at
<http://www.buildvalue2001.com>.

Join speakers such as Bob Pittman (AOL), Jeff Mallett (Yahoo!), David
Peterschmidt (Inktomi), Shelby Bonnie (CNet), and Mark Walsh (VerticalNet)
who presented cutting edge topics to a sold out audience of CEOs at last
year's conference titled "Brands Driving the New Economy". Prior conferences
have also included corporate visionaries and luminaries such as John Hagel
III & Marc Singer (McKinsey & Co.), Francis Ford Coppola (Coppola
Companies), Howard Schultz (Starbucks), David Aaker (author), Meg Whitman
(eBay), Harry Dent (author/speaker), Bob Fisher (Gap), and Cindy Crawford
(eStyle, Inc.) to name a few.   We anticipate this year's speaker roster to
be even more impressive.

Build Value 2001's continuing strategic sponsors, with whom you will have
many opportunities to interact, include some of the most innovative and
forward thinking players in Silicon Valley today:  Redpoint Ventures, Banc
of America Securities, Silicon Valley Bank, CNET, Heidrick & Struggles,
Cooley Godward and Citron Haligman Bedecarre.  Venture Strategy Partners,
Build Value's founding host, is a venture capital firm focused on
accelerating the growth of emerging businesses across a spectrum of
technologies.

I know your perspective and vision will be greatly appreciated and I, along
with my colleagues, would be honored to have you as a distinguished speaker.
Our office will follow up with you this coming week to confirm your
participation.  In the interim, please feel free to call me directly at
415-558-8600 with any questions or talk with Pug Winokur about the power of
this forum.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,

Joanna
