Just had to share this with all of you.  It seems Enron employees make an 
impression everywhere we go.  This email from an Enron admirer reinforces why 
Enron is one of the best places to work - the employees.

I just had to write to tell you about your wonderful employees! Yes,
Enron Field is the most comfortable, beautiful Baseball Stadium I've
ever been in, but your employees make it great!

I was at yesterdays Inaugural Game (March 30, 2000). Everyone with an
Enron Shirt had a smile on their face and a "Hello" on their lips. My
husband and I had to purchase our tickets through a ticket company, but
the couple next to us got theirs' at COST. How? Well they said they were
in line at Ticketron when she heard everyone talking about the Inaugural
Game at Enron Field. An Enron Employee answered all this lady's (my
seat neighbor at the game) questions and OFFERED her AT COST to sell her
two of her 8 tickets (she said this is what Enron gave to her).
If that wasn't enough, a kind gentleman (wearing an Enron Shirt) was
standing in the concession line (very long lines up in the mezzanine
section), and gently mentioned to me where the line started. After I
went to the back of the line, he offered to help me buy my soda. A very
thoughtful consciences Employee for Enron!
Thank you for the beautiful BallPark, the beautiful hat we were given
and most importantly your wonderful representatives, your Employees!
Sincerely,
Patti Chapman
