Ms. Sera,

Thank you for your message.  My direct # is (617) 353-4338 and if I am not
there, my assistant Holly usually knows my schedule and how to track me down.

Also, please know that although I grew up in Maine, I consider Texas my home
away from home.  Feel free to call anytime and please let Jeff know I look
forward to meeting him via the telephone.

Sincerely,

Jane

Ms. Robinson,

I'm writing on behalf of Jeff Skilling, to whom Kay Cole introduced to you
via e-mail.  He would like to speak to you by phone regarding his daughter
Kristin's potential interest in attending Boston University.  Would you be
willing to provide us with your phone number?

Please let us know if there is anything we can do to assist you with your
future visits to Houston.  I looking forward to hearing from you soon.

Regards,
Sherri Sera
