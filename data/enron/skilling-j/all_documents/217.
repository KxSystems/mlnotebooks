Hi Mark.  I heard you guys had a great time in Africa - it's hard to believe 
it has already come and gone!

Just wondering if you still have your unused KLM ticket for the 
Istanbul/Amsterdam/Nairobi leg of the trip.  That is a refundable ticket, so 
if you would return it to me I can get Jeff's card credited for the charge - 
I believe it's in the neighborhood of $2,000.  If you have it, just drop it 
in the mail to:

Sherri Sera

Thanks and take care,
Sherri
