In anticipation of re-opening, you have an opportunity to pre-select your new 
locker location.  All active Body Shop members who had a permanent locker at 
the time of the September 1st construction close have been given first 
consideration when selecting their new locker location before December 29th.  
 Priority will be given to member's original locker location (i.e. a member 
who requests their original locker area will be given priority for that 
space).  After this date lockers will be distributed to members on the 
waiting list and to member's with permanent lockers who request a different 
space from their original locker area.   For your convenience, a Body Shop 
enrolment and locker request table will be in the lobby from December 18th 
through January 5th between the hours of 11am - 1:30pm. 



Follow these simple steps to secure your locker location:
Open and review the attached Men's Locker Design template.
Select your 1st, 2nd, and 3rd choice location preference.
Complete the Locker Selection Request Form.  
Complete and Sign the Locker Payroll Deduction Form.
Return all completed forms before December 29th to the Body Shop at EB1355, 
drop off at our offices on EB1372 or at the Body Shop Table in the lobby from 
December 18th through January 5th between the hours of 11am - 1:30pm.

You will receive an e-mail notifying you of your new locker location and 
locker combination prior to re-opening.  If you have any questions, please 
contact Noel Ryan at  x35548.
