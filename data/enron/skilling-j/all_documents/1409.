Dear Mr. Skilling:

We are selling the title sponsorship of Atlanta=01,s Lenox Square, the most
prestigious shopping mall in the South. Nearly 25 million people visit Leno=
x
annually, more than attends the games of a Major League Baseball team in a
decade. This is an outstanding deal, priced below naming rights of stadium
and arena deals done recently. Simon Property Group, the leader in the
shopping mall industry, owns and operates Lenox and this is their first
naming rights deal. Do you have interest? If so, please contact me at your
earliest convenience.

Sincerely,

Kevin L. Sullivan
