Ok, I'll tell you what I've told everyone else - the pledges Jeff has 
received range from $20 to $6000.  So, pledge with your heart, keeping your 
pocketbook in mind!  By the way, Jeff finished the ride in just over 14 
hours!  SRS

I know how incredibly busy you all are, so I'm sure that making a pledge to 
Jeff for the MS150 has simply slipped your mind.  Well the ride is this 
weekend, time is running out and we need you!

Enron's goal is to raise $700,000, and Jeff's personal goal is to raise 
$50,000.  As of today, we are a little better than half way there.  Won't you 
consider helping him reach his goal?

Thanks for your consideration.  I look forward to hearing from you tomorrow...

Sherri :-)
