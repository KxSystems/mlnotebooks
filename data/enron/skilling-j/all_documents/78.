Howdy,

West is best, I guess, (and apparently now more ethnically mixed?)

Trip to Washington sounds great.  Once when I was there, maybe 5 or 6 years
ago, I had the opportunity to visit a congresswomen's office, as I knew an
intern there.  Was, among other things, escorted to the Capital
building(through tunnels that lead under the Mall from the various office
buildings to the Capital building) where I saw a few hours of a
Congressional debate on one of the many campaign reform bills that have
passed through those (not so hallowed?) halls.  The debate very interesting,
not the least reason being that it was made before only a couple dozen of
the 500 or so congresspeople (the rest, I was told, were monitoring the
debate on TVs in their offices).  At the few times that a quorum of the
members actually have to be present (for, say, an impeachment vote), a bell
rings and congresspeople hustle through the above mentioned tunnels to
register their vote, after which they hustle back.  It's something to see.
Good luck with the application.

YOU MUST, while in DC, see the Holocaust Museum.  I Mean MUST.  Should make
reservation (probably can use the Internet), as I understand it's booked up
far in advance.  The museum's right off the Mall so is conveniently located.
  The most powerful museum I've ever been too.

Turkish course finishes in two weeks.  Then to Israel during first week of
April, to Italy during second week.

Bursa was very impressive.  Not nearly as dilapidated as (most of) Istanbul.
  Was the first capital of the Ottoman Empire, so there are important
historical buildings from, among other centuries, the 13th.  Now, a bit of a
sprawl, and industrial. The city center sits at the bottom of the slope of a
huge mountain (its ragged, snowcapped peak breaking out of the clouds
periodically), and thus there are fine views in both directions.

More later,

Love,

Mark
