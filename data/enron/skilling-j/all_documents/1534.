Gil,

Jeff asked me to let you know that he really appreciates this opportunity, 
but his time in the office is at such a premium right now due to his heavy 
travel schedule, it would be difficult at best to work them in.  He has 
turned down several invitations to join boards because he just can't commit 
the time.  So, while he is flattered by their interest, if and when Mr. 
Quackenbush calls we will decline.

It was nice talking to you.  Glad to hear all is well.

Yours faithfully, Sherri ;-)

Jeff,

Great to see Enron and you doing so well.  Congratulations on the -belated-
CEO ship, the blowout first quarter,
and the recent piece in Bloomberg.

Since we last met Luminant has done a important and impactful work for Enron
(EES, Enron Networks, Global
Sourcing, Broadband among others).  The Oasis and the Websource Intranet
sites are examples of the results of
this work.  Phillippe recently selected Luminant as one five integrators
that Enron will use going forward.

David Quackenbush, Luminants COO, has been personally involved in leading
the work at Enron.  He and
Jim Corey Luminant's CEO would like to have the opportunity of meeting with
you, bringing you up to date
on the work, and inviting you to consider joining the Luminant board.

I am no longer affiliated with Luminant but David asked me to let you know
of their interest.  He will be
following up and seeing if there will be an opportunity for you to meet with
them.

Regards,

Gil Marmol
