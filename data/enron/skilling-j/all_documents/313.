 1. Nine Classes To Celebrate Reunions At Homecoming October 26-29
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Graduates of the classes of 1955, '60, '65, '70, '75, '80, '85, '90, and
'95 will celebrate reunions during this year's Homecoming weekend, October
26-29. Reunion alumni have several opportunities to participate in events
especially for them, including parties on The Boulevard before and after
the SMU-Nevada game and special club-level tours of the Gerald J. Ford
Stadium and Paul B. Loyd Jr. All-Sports Complex.

Activities for all members of the SMU community include performances,
panel discussions, the 2000 Distinguished Alumni Awards celebration,
Homecoming luncheon, open houses in SMU's schools and libraries, campus
tours, the "Pigskin Revue" dinner, the All-School Gathering, and the
lighted Homecoming Parade, featuring grand marshals and Pro Football Hall
of Fame members Raymond Berry ('55) and Lamar Hunt ('56).

 2. Beta's '75 Planning "Mother of All Homecomings"
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The 25th reunion of those hilarious Beta boys appears to be not only in full

swing, thanks to the efforts of lead organizer Fred "Beek" Haulenbeek of
Vermont, but an event for the ages.  Just of few of the planned activities
for the weekend include:  A return trip to Mineola in a Ryder truck,
complete with an Officer Caffey-led SMU security escort.  A re-enactment at
somebody's house named Elvis (believed to be Wayne Thompson) of something
called a dork, or dorg, or whatever, complete with a liver and onions dinner

served up by several canines in the neighborhood.  The first presentation of

what Beta's hope to be an annual tradition, the election of the Ellen Parker

Memorial Award, which will be given to the D.O.D. (whatever that is) present

at Graceland who passes out on the commode while the party is in full
progress, then defecates into one of the alum's blankets while being driven
over to the Zeta House.  And last but certainly not least, something called
a GIANT BETA BU-FU, which will involve only the male members of the
gathering, preferably in a bottom bunk in old room #4 of the Beta House.
Also being honored at the homecoming festivities will be this year's
inductees into the Beta Hall of Shame, led by 2000's newest members, Jim
Wicklund, Rick East, Hunter Armistead, and Doug Denham.  Sounds like a blast

to all of us here at the SMU Alumni Center--you don't want to miss it.

3. Meadows Kicks Off Year-Long Celebration Of Spanish Art and Culture
------------------------------------------------------------------------

SMU's Meadows School of the Arts is celebrating the March 2001 opening of
the new Meadows Museum with "Bridging Cultures: A Year of Spanish Art and
Tradition at SMU." The series of events, many of them free and open to the
public, will entertain and educate on the culture, traditions, and history
of Spain through lectures, performances, screenings, and
exhibitions. Located on the SMU campus, the Meadows Museum houses one of
the finest collections of Spanish art outside of Spain.

Upcoming events for October include the Meadows Festival of Spanish Film,
featuring screenings of films by Imanol Uribe, Victor Erice, Jose Luis
Guerin, and Carlos Saura, October 11-14 in the Bob Hope Theatre; and "The
Stars at Night...The Mystery of Santiago de Compostela," an art history
lecture by John Williams of the University of Pittsburgh, October 26 at 5
p.m., Room B600, Owen Arts Center.

Events for Meadows Museum members include "Images of the Spanish Civil
War," a lecture by James K. Hopkins, professor of history in SMU's Dedman
College of Humanities and Sciences, October 10, 7:30 p.m., in the old
Meadows Museum, Owen Arts Center. For information on becoming a Museum
member, call 214-768-4153.

Ongoing events include an exhibition on Spanish history in the foyer of
SMU's Bridwell Library. A series of month-long exhibitions will feature
Spanish manuscripts, Spanish Bibles banned by the Inquisition, and
artists' books by Picasso and Dali. Hours are 8:30 a.m.-5
p.m. Monday-Friday through May 2001.

For tickets and more information on monthly events, call 214-768-ARTS.


 4. Susan Faludi To Deliver Louise Raggio Lecture October 11
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Writer Susan Faludi will deliver the Louise Ballerstedt Raggio Endowed
Lecture in Women's Studies on Wednesday, October 11, at 8 p.m. in the
Hughes-Trigg Student Center. Faludi is a Pulitzer Prize-winning
journalist, winner of the National Book Critics Circle Award, and the
best-selling author of "Backlash: The Undeclared War Against American
Women" and "Stiffed: The Betrayal of the American Male."

The Raggio Lecture Series brings role models of vision and achievement to
SMU to speak on gender and women's issues. Launched in 1998, the lecture
series honors Louise Raggio -- the only female in the SMU law class of
1952, the first woman assistant district attorney in Dallas, the first
woman director of the State Bar of Texas and chair of the board of the
Texas Bar Foundation, and chair of the Family Law Section of the Texas Bar
and the American Bar.

Tickets are free for SMU students, faculty, and staff, and $10 for the
general public. For more information, call 214-768-2610.


 4. SMU Establishes Company To Develop New Pharmaceutical Products
------------------------------------------------------------------------

SMU, in partnership with Research Corporation Technologies, has
established a new company to create pharmaceutical compounds based on the
work of John Buynak, associate professor of chemistry in SMU's Dedman
College of Humanities and Sciences. The company, called AlamX, is the
first such company SMU has established. Buynak has spent more than a
decade developing compounds to help fight antibiotic-resistant bacteria,
an increasing problem due to indiscriminate use of antibiotics, increases
in resistant strains of bacteria, and lack of comprehensive infection
control in many hospitals.

Christopher Martin of Research Corporation Technologies will serve as
manager of AlamX. Martin says AlamX will select several of Buynak's
compounds, match them with existing antibiotics, and screen these
combinations against a panel of resistant microorganisms. According to the
Centers for Disease Control, an estimated 500 million acute infections in
the United States require antibiotic treatment each year. In 1998, the
market for anti-infective drugs was more than $14 billion. Martin
estimates that a product effective against several classes of compounds
known to promote bacterial resistance to antibiotics could generate annual
sales in excess of $1 billion worldwide.

 5. Legal Clinic Students Win Federal Civil Rights Case
------------------------------------------------------------------------

In a case tried by students from the SMU School of Law's Legal Clinic, a
paraplegic has won a federal lawsuit against Dallas County for injuries he
suffered in the county jail infirmary. The complex civil rights case marks
a significant victory for the SMU School of Law's 50-year-old Civil
Clinic. Supervised by Professor Maureen Armour, associate dean for
clinical education and co-director of the Civil Clinic, more than 20
students, working in groups over 10 school terms, represented 41-year-old
Brent Lawson. Armour, who also teaches civil rights legislation, says that
although civil rights cases against local governments are not that
unusual, "it's extremely difficult to win one."

While in the Dallas County Lew Sterrett Justice Center in the fall of
1993, Lawson developed decubitus ulcers, a potentially life-threatening
condition caused by unrelieved pressure on the body. He was admitted to
the jail pending a parole revocation hearing. U.S. District Judge Jerry
Buchmeyer ruled that Lawson, who is confined to a wheelchair, should not
have been admitted to the jail because it lacked proper medical staff and
equipment to attend to his special needs. Judge Buchmeyer ruled August 30
in a 40-page opinion that the jail acted "with deliberate indifference" to
Lawson's constitutional rights to be free from cruel and unusual
punishment. In addition to finding Dallas County liable for its treatment
of Lawson, Buchmeyer ordered the county to pay $250,000 in damages for his
pain and suffering.

 6. Mustang Athletes Shine In Sydney; Frolander Wins Gold In 100M Fly
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Former Mustang athlete and 1998 NCAA Men's Swimmer of the Year Lars
Frolander ('99) took the gold medal in the men's 100-meter butterfly at
the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia. Frolander, competing for his
native Sweden, won with a time of 52.00. The butterfly gold is Frolander's
second Olympic medal. He was a member of the Swedish team that won silver
in the men's 4x100M freestyle relay at the 1996 Games in Atlanta, the same
race in which his Mustang teammate Ryan Berube ('96) helped earn gold for
the United States. Frolander also competed in the 100M free and again on
Sweden's 4x100M free relay team, finishing sixth in both events.

SMU's 1999 NCAA Women's Swimmer of the Year, Martina Moravcova ('98, '99),
took two silver medals -- in the 100M fly and the 200M free -- for her
home nation of Slovakia. Moravcova, who became her country's first Olympic
medalist since 1908, also finished fifth in the 50M and 100M free
events. (SMU head coach Steve Collins, who is also Moravcova's personal
coach, served as honorary head coach for the Slovakian team.) Her Olympic
teammates recognized her achievements by choosing her to carry the
Slovakian flag in the closing ceremonies Sunday night. Another SMU
swimmer, Rania Elwani ('99), competed for Egypt in the semifinals of the
women's 50M and 100M freestyle. Incoming first-year student Anu Koivisto
of Finland competed in the women's 200M and 100M backstroke events.

The Mustang Olympic track and field contingent was led by Sweden's Kasja
Bergqvist ('99); the 1999 NCAA champion won the bronze medal in the
women's high jump. Junior thrower Janus Robberts won a seventh-place
finish for South Africa in the men's shot put. Discus throwers Jason Tunks
('99, Canada) and Alex Tammert ('98, Estonia) placed sixth and ninth in
the men's finals; Ian Winchester ('96, New Zealand) and Robert Weir ('85,
Great Britain) also competed. Teri Tunks ('98), an SMU assistant track
coach, threw for Team USA in the women's shot put. Former Mustang
Christophe Epalle (France) and current SMU junior Libor Charfreitag
(Slovakia) competed in the men's hammer throw. Junior Roman Oravec
competed for the Czech Republic in the men's 800M run.

In team sports, Claudia Brassard-Riebesehl ('99) played for the Canada
women's basketball squad, which advanced to the Classification 9-10
(pre-quarterfinal) game and finished the tournament in 10th place.

 7. School Of Theology Receives $12.1 Million In Scholarship Support
------------------------------------------------------------------------

A collective total of $12.1 million has been pledged for scholarships in
Southern Methodist University's Perkins School of Theology. Donors include
15 area conferences in the United Methodist Church's eight-state South
Central Jurisdiction; Charles and Elizabeth Perkins Prothro of Wichita
Falls, Texas; and other individuals in the jurisdiction. The Prothros'
$4.7 million grant matching conference and individual pledges provided
impetus for the highly successful theology scholarship campaign. Their
son, C. Vincent (Vin) Prothro, and his wife, Caren, pledged $1 million to
the Perkins campaign.

The Texas Conference, which serves the Houston-Galveston area, pledged $1
million, matched by the Moody Memorial First United Methodist Church in
Galveston. The remaining conference donors have pledged to raise between
$100,000 and $1 million each, to be matched by the Prothro family and the
Perkins Foundation.

 8. Gift Funds Geurin-Pettus Chair In Politics and Political Economy
------------------------------------------------------------------------

A gift of $2.5 million from Jo Ann and Sherrill Pettus of Graham, Texas,
will establish a new distinguished faculty chair in American politics and
political economy at SMU. The endowed chair will be the first step toward
developing a new graduate degree program in the Department of Political
Science in Dedman College of Humanities and Sciences.

The new faculty chair will be known as the Geurin-Pettus Distinguished
Chair in American Politics and Political Economy. To fill the chair, the
University will seek a scholar whose research and teaching relate directly
to domestic public policy and governmental and fiscal issues. In addition
to teaching at SMU, the chairholder will spearhead development of a
program to include relevant conferences and forums. The Pettus gift also
will help fund this program.
