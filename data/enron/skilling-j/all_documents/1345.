We regret to announce that with the reduced emphasis on developing large 
infrastructure projects in certain countries, a number of individuals have 
elected to leave Enron.  Diomedes Christodoulou, formerly Chief Commercial 
Officer of Enron Broadband Services, James Bannantine, formerly CEO of Enron 
South America, and Sanjay Bhatnagar, formerly CEO of Enron Broadband Services 
for the Middle East and Asia, have elected to leave Enron to pursue other 
opportunities.  Diomedes, Jim and Sanjay built and led strong and talented 
teams at Enron.  We wish all of these individuals the very best in their new 
endeavors.
