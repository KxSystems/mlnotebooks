Hi Jeff,

Jane Robinson returned  last night and I gave her a heads-up on Kristen.

I checked with the Harvard Club and found some good news.  The entrance
fee for non-residents is waived until the end of April.

If you are interested in rejoining (or joining) you may contact Brenda
Bouchard.

Regards,

Kay
