Jeff,

Judy Lay Allen, an associate of yours on the Federal Reserve board, spoke 
with Joannie Williamson today regarding my desire to interview at Enron.

I am a graduate of Princeton University with two years experience in 
financial modeling and communications.   Towards assessing my skill set 
relative to peers, I took and received a 740 on my GMAT.  I have also 
interned in a gas exploration company and am familiar with the industry; 
likewise, I have worked with clients in telecommunications and am aware of 
the work Enron is doing in the bandwidth trading/pooling field.

I am aware of Enron's executive training/business analyst programs and am 
highly interested in exploring opportunities therein.  I am in Houston 
through Friday evening and, given the short notice, would be grateful for any 
opportunity to meet with the appropriate person any time Thursday or Friday.

I look forward to interviewing and applying my experience at Enron.

Best regards,
Michael Kuntz
