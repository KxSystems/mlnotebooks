Jeff,
Having read the most recent issue of Information  week, I was compelled to 
contact you. Developed out of Stanford University our  technology is 
specifically designed to create efficiencies and competitive  advantage for 
companies such as Enron.
As you are building your vision for 2001,  I?think that it would 
be?imperative to assess our products  capabilities,?I would like to set a 
time to introduce and  demonstrate?our value to your evolving strategy. We 
are currently  discussing and demonstrating the value of our technology to 
executive teams at:  KnightRidder, eBay, Manpower,?Siebel and Monster.com and 
would like  the?opportunity to impress you! 
?
Sincerely,
?
?
