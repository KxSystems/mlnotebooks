Jeff, it would be great if you could arrange your schedule to attend IBM's
2001 CEO conference which begins with a dinner on June 12 and includes a
full day program on June 13, 2001. We plan to have 20 CEOs in attendance
and this will give you a chance to meet a few of the other senior
executives of IBM, including Lou Gerstner. Sam Palmisano will also be
there.  I've included some information below on the conference, attendees
at the last session and tentative agenda, which may help you decide. If you
can make it, Lou will send you a formal invitation letter. Please let me
know if I can provide any other information for you.

Thanks.

Gail
