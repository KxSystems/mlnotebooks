Subject: Montana Forest Fire picture

This picture was taken in the Bitterroot National Forest in Montana on
August 6, 2000 by a fire behavior analyst from Fairbanks, Alaska by the name
of John McColgan with a Digital camera.  Since he was working while he took
the picture, he cannot sell or profit from it so you might otherwise not get
to see it.
