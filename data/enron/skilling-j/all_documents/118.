Per our discussion at the Executive Committee meeting this morning, please 
identify 2 representatives for the Associate and Analyst PRC process and 1 
individual as commercial staffing lead.  The criteria for these individuals 
are as follows:

PRC Representatives
The PRC for Associates and Analysts will be conducted like the VP and MD 
process.   A committee selected by Executive Committee members will 
facilitate the process.  The Office of the Chairman believes that 
participation in the Associate and Analyst PRC should be a platform for 
exposure to election to the next level in the organization.  Consequently, 
Associate PRC representatives should be Vice Presidents who are on promotion 
track to MD and Analyst representatives should be Directors who are on 
promotion track to Vice President. 

Commercial Staffing Leads
 We need your assistance to determine accurate hiring targets to ensure that 
the talent we attract will be valued and utilized meaningfully.   The Office 
of the Chairman is ultimately holding each CEO accountable for working with 
the Program Staffing Coordinators to staff the talent and to determine the 
hiring goals.  The CEO may delegate this responsibility to a highly 
respected, interested, senior commercial person.  This responsibility should 
not be delegated to an HR representative.
Please provide the names by end of the day tomorrow,  5/9/00.  Thanks, to 
those of you who have responded.
Charlene
