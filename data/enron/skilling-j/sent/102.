John, you should have received a copy of the e-mail you sent to Jeff, which I 
in turn forwarded to Greg Whalley.  To bring you up to speed - Greg Whalley 
is the Chairman & CEO of Enron Net Works - EnronOnline and all IT resides in 
this business unit (in some of the e-mails in the string you sent me, Jay 
Fitzgerald and Jenny Rub were mentioned - they both report to Greg).  If you 
don't hear from him within a reasonable amount of time, please let me know.

Hope all is well...

Regards,
Sherri
