Kevin, I got your message about not being available for dinner -  no 
problem.  The other panelists were arriving too late also, so the dinner was 
cancelled.

I just wanted to touch base and make sure you had everything thing you need 
for tomorrow morning.  I'm attaching a map to the North Shepherd facility; 
it's about 10 minutes outside of downtown.  I would be happy to make 
arrangements for a sedan to pick you up if you like; just let me know from 
where.

The event begins with a buffet breakfast at 7:30 a.m. and your panel will 
begin at 8:45 a.m.  Jeff would like to meet with you, David Arnoff  and John 
Thornton around 8:15 a.m. to cover any last minute items about the panel.

I'll be at the North Shepherd facility beginning about 2:00 p.m. CDT today, 
so you can reach me on my cell phone (713.854.1426).  Do not hesitate to call 
me should you have any questions or need additional information as I will not 
have access to e-mail after 2:00 p.m.

Regards, SRS
