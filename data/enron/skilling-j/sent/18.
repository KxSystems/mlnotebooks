Mr Skilling,

I would like to have the opportunity of talking with you  in person for 15=
=20
min.-or-so sometime=20
in the next couple of weeks (any time after Tuesday=01(I=01,m currently in=
=20
California helping to kick-off the
Sun/BOS development team). I would like to talk to you about a couple of=20
specific concerns I have
about the overall EBS organization.=20

I have now been involved in ECI/EBS since our acquisition a year ago (I was=
=20
in the Modulus group).  So=20
I have first-hand knowledge of the development cycles of all of the current=
=20
EBS products.

I also believe that I am in a fairly unique position in that I am not in an=
y=20
particular =01&political=018 faction=20
(I really don=01,t play the political game=01(I have enough Enron options t=
hat I=20
don=01,t need to ).   And
I believe that I am fairly well respected by everyone (i.e. I don=01,t have=
 any=20
enemies!).

That, combined with my broad software and hardware technical background=20
(including developing=20
and supporting the InterAgent product for several years), gives me some=20
useful insights into some of=20
the technical  and structural issues of EBS.

If you cannot meet, then I can describe my concerns in an e-mail, if you=20
prefer.

Please let me know if you are available.  I will also try to call your offi=
ce=20
to arrange a meeting.
I can be reached on my cell phone: 713-503-2605. =20

Thank you for your time.
