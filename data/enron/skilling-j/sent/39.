Dear Mr. Paul,

I'm writing on behalf of Jeff Skilling, who asked me to let you know that he 
will send you a check in the amount of $200.  

While Jeff would probably be to modest to tell you himself, I thought you 
might be interested to know that he has been named the National MS Society's 
2000 Man of the Year, and will be honored at a dinner on September 30.  He 
has been a big supporter of the MS Society, primarily through his riding the 
MS150 from Houston to Austin since 1997.  This year's ride is April 15-16, 
and he has been busy collecting pledges - $20,000 so far, which will be 
matched by the Enron dollar-for-dollar.  Enron Corp. has the largest MS150 
team in the nation in terms of dollars raised, and this year our goal is 
$350,000.  It appears that our 378-person team has already blown through that 
goal and is well on its way to raising $400,000.  As MS has touched my 
family, I am very proud to be associated with a man and a company who so 
actively support research to find a cure.

I'm sure Jeff will write a personal note when he returns to town and sends 
his check.  In the meantime, good luck with your fund raising, and have a 
nice weekend.

Regards,
Sherri Sera
Assistant to Jeff Skilling, President & COO
Enron Corp.

To All Brother Beta's (and El!!),  3 weeks ago Woody Berry and I took a trip
to Rockford, Illinois to visit Phil Morrow, who has been struggling with MS
for the past 12 years.  The pictures tell the rest of the story.  I would
say that speaking for Woody that the trip was very bitter/sweet.  Bottom
line:  count your blessings, we never know what life has in store for us.

I will be hosting my Annual MS Walk/ Party in May.  I have done this for the
last 10 years.  I initially thought it would be a good thing for me to do as
I thought I had MS!!  Fortunately, my Neurologist thinks that I had a small
stroke back in '91 (never thought having a stroke would have been GOOD
news!!).

Now, I host the party in honor of Phil Morrow in hopes that we can find a
cure to help him.  As always, I collect donations from anyone and everyone
who is interested and/or able.  If you would like to send in a donation,
simply write out a check for whatever amount to:   NMSS (National Multiple
Sclerosis Society) and send it to:

Chuck Paul
6193 Forest Hills Dr.
Norcross,  Ga.  30092-4513

My email address is listed below.  If you have any other Beta's who you
think would like to see these pictures, please forward them on.

PS  First game at the new Ford Stadium on the SMU campus will be 9/2/00 at
6PM against KU.  Homecoming this year will be October 28th.  The new stadium
is looking GREAT!  I hope to be at both games but definitely at Homecoming.
Hope to see many of you there.  We will even have a 'tailgating' section
with 'adult beverages' allowed!!!
