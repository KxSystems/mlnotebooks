Hi, Mark.  The itinerary is changing a little bit with regard to where you 
are staying while in Africa, so I will forward the latest and greatest as 
soon as I get it.  Probably sometime late this week...

Just wanted to be sure that you are working on getting your Tanzanian visa 
and getting the required shots.

Congratulations on the new job - I guess this means you'll be staying for a 
while?

Sherri
