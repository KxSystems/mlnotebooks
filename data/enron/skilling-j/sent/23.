Michael, I'm responding on behalf of Jeff Skilling, who is traveling abroad.

It appears that this is informational only for Jeff, and you are not inviting 
him to attend the meetings.  If this is an invitation to attend, he is unable 
to as he will still be traveling abroad.

Sherri

Subject: Azurix Investment Banking Meeting

I have made some arrangements in scheduling potential investment bankers to 
talk with us about our current project.  I have informed them about our 
current situation and thinking, and they will be prepared to present their 
ideas on deal process, potential investors/buyers, valuation, fee proposal, 
credentials etc.  I plan to make a decision very quickly regarding whom we 
will work with, and get the process moving as quickly as possible.

We will meet with Merrill Lynch on Monday February 28 (a time has not yet 
been designated)
Schroder's will be in our offices on Wednesday March 1, 2000 at 9:30 am
I am still trying to schedule a date and time with Nicholas Wrigley and 
Rothchild

I would greatly appreciate your letting me know if (1) you have interest in 
attending these meetings and (2) you can attend a Merrill meeting on Monday 
and the Schroder's meeting on Wednesday.  Thanks.
