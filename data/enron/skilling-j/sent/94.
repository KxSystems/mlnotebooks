Roxanne, there may be an opportunity to bring a guest, but I am waiting to 
get RSVPs from the entire group before offering that as tickets are limited.  
I'll be back in touch as soon as I've heard from the entire class.

Sherri,

I would definitely like to have a ticket.  Are guests invited or is it 
limited to members of the Seal Class #64?  If guests are invited, I would 
love to have one additional ticket.

My office address is as follows:

Roxanne Piper
c/o Tucker Alan Inc.
1415 Louisiana Street
Suite 3250
Houston, TX  77002

Please thank Jeff for arranging this outing -- it sounds like it will be a 
lot of fun!!  Call me at (713) 651-7217 if you have any questions.

Roxanne Piper
