Karen, Jeff is traveling today.  Is this the type of release that I should 
try to get to him before it goes out?  Please advise.  RS

FYI, the attached press is scheduled to be issued by SAVVIS tomorrow, June 
20.  The release announces a distribution partnership -- SAVVIS will provide 
the last mile, and we will provide long-haul access.
