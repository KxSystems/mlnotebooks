Dear Jeff,

?

Thank you for setting aside time to meet with me.? I have attached my resume 
to help bring you up to date on my career.? 

?

As you will see, I have been providing advisory services since 1995.?? During 
these years, I have done some of my best work.? I am proud of the service 
that I have rendered as an independent consultant.? 

?

Now, I feel it is time to move to a new chapter in my career.? I look forward 
to sitting down with you to think through ways to apply my experience, 
intellect and energies to new professional challenges.? I respect you 
tremendously, and wherever the next part of my career may lie, I know that my 
search and choice will benefit significantly from your perspective.

?

Finally, I am attaching the recommendation to HBS that you wrote in 1981.? I 
found it during a profoundly challenging period in my life.? Your historic 
words of support helped me keep fighting and successfully moving forward.

?

If you would like to reach me before our meeting, please call (213) 926-2626 
or email kevinscott@onlinemailbox.net.? Thank you again.

?

Sincerely,
