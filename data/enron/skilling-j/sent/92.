Jeff:

I am taking the liberty of writing this note to you regarding a tremendous 
potential business opportunity that has to do with trading of Foreign 
Exchange Online . The idea is to bring the clients and the banks together 
where  the banks can bid to buy or sell when business clients wants to buy or 
sell certain currency. My understanding is that the total foreign exchange 
turnover per day is in several trillion dollar range.  Currently, I am 
working in Santa Cruz, Bolivia as President/General Manager of Bolivian 
portion of Bolivia to Brazil pipeline and may not be up to speed on Enron's 
activities in this area.   If we are already doing this, please disregard 
this note and accept my appologies for taking your time and, if we are not 
doing this, here is my two cents worth and let me know if I can do anything 
to implement it. 

I would also like to take this opportunity to thank you for your leadership 
in making this such a great company. I have been with the company for last 
twenty years and it has been a phenomenal experience. The best part is that 
we have just  began.  I am very excited about  the future growth 
opportunities of  EBS and am looking forward to contributing in that area one 
of these days.  


Regards,

Nasim Khan
