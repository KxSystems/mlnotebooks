Mike, Jeff's intent is not that you would interview, but that you would put 
the hammer (so to speak!) on some of your people to sign up.  

Have a good weekend!  SRS

Jeff,

Sorry, I can't participate on Saturday.  I have serious commitments that I 
can't break specifically on Saturday.  I know that we are short people and I 
do take this process very seriously.
