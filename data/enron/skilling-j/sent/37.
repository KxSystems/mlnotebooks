They don't have to be with the others, so this is perfect.  Thanks, Greg.  If 
it's easier, I can come to you...I know you guys are swamped.  SRS

PS - I didn't realize that I sent you an e-mail from Jeff's box - didn't mean 
to alarm you if I did!

Sherri-

This is not a problem.  I probably can't get them with the other two but they 
will be in the same area.  I will bring them up some time this afternoon.  
Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks!

Greg

Greg, if there are two more tickets available for sale for Friday's game, I'd 
like to buy them.  Let me know.  Thanks, SRS
