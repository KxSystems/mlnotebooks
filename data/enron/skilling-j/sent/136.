Edward, Jeff is booked solid today and Friday and traveling tomorrow.  He 
then will be on vacation from December 18-January 2.  I would suggest that 
you send him an e-mail.  If he needs any additional information, we can try 
to get the two of you together for a few minutes the morning of the 
interview.  SRS

Subject: Businessweek interview

Jeff,

I spoke with Mark Palmer concerning the interview with Businessweek magazine, 
January 2nd.  He has asked me to participate in the article to discuss Enron 
Media Services and thought it would be a good idea for me  to give you a 
quick update in the event the reporter questions you about the business.  Let 
me know if you would like for me to stop by or call you to bring you up to 
date.   I will be out on vacation December 20th returning January 2nd.

Congratulations on your appointment to CEO.


Edward Ondarza
