Subject: Chairman's Award - Roundtable Review

Jeff

I am facilitating the 2000 Chairman's Award process and am presently 
arranging a time to present the Selection Committee's recommendations to the 
Office of the Chairman.  I have spoken with Sherri to get on your calendar 
and understand that you have a very busy October.  I am scheduled to meet 
with Ken on October 25 at 9:00am.  If you are agreeable, I will meet with him 
first and then present the approved finalists for your review when you are 
available.

Please let me know if this plan is acceptable - thank you.

Charla
