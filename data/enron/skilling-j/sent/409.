Dear Mr. Skilling:
?
On Wednesday, October 24, we will be presenting the  9th annual President's 
Forum of Houston at the HESS Club.? Over 150 business owners in the Greater 
Houston area will  attend this by-invitation-only conference.? The goal is to 
help  business owners grow their  businesses.
?
Mr. Ken Lay was the Kick-Off speaker for this  program 2 years ago.? We would 
be very honored if you
could do the same thing this year.? I know  that you are leaving for South 
America that day, but you might
take a 1/2 hour break in your schedule first thing  in the morning to speak 
to our group!? The Kick-Off is scheduled for 8:30  a.m.
?

The Entrepreneurship Institute is a non-profit  organization that was founded 
in 1976.? The goal of TEI is
to put on programs for business owners with the  sole purpose of helping 
those business owners grow their businesses.? This  will be the 9thh annual 
program in Houston.? We currently have chapters in  22 cities in the US.? You 
can find out more about us at our website - www.tei.net.
?
Thank you for Your consideration!
?
Jack Freeh, Vice President? (jlfreeh@parkcity.net or  435-655-0970)
