John, any chance you can sent this e-mail to me?  Apparently it has a 
"confidential" stamp on it, so even though I have access to Jeff's mailbox, 
it won't allow me to open it.  Unfortunately, Jeff does not check his own 
e-mail, and if I go into his machine, I won't be able to print it as it is 
not connected to any printer.

Thanks, John.  I'll see that Jeff gets it as soon as it's received.  SRS
