Dear David,

At Jeff's request, I'm writing to let you know that he does not wish to meet 
at this time.  The current demands on his time dictate that he schedule only 
meetings of the highest priority.  His personal finances and investments are 
in order; therefore, he thanks you for the opportunity to meet, but 
respectfully declines.

Regards,
Sherri Sera
Assistant to Jeff Skilling

Jeff,
I had called Sherrie to see if we could meet, together with my partner,
Jordan Larimore, now that we are both reaffiliated with Lehman.
The proposed meeting was not about Lehman's Private Venture offering per se,
but rather about reestablishing a broader Private Client relationship
between you and Lehman.
I look forward to hearing from you and wish you well on your trip.
Best regards

David C. Morris
Sr. VP Lehman Brothers
