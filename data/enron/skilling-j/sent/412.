Why don't you reserve a conference room.  That way Jeff can leave when he 
needs to and everyone else can continue meeting.

Thanks,
Joannie

Yes, Ken will be present for the first hour with Jeff and Partha has asked 
for an additional hour with Ken following that meeting.  Would you like me to 
secure a conference room for both meetings or have Jeff's portion in his 
office and then have them come down to Ken's office for the second hour?

Dorothy, I have this meeting scheduled on Jeff's calendar from 1:30 - 2:30.  
Do you anticipate Jeff and Ken being present for the first hour of the 
meeting, and Ken handling the second hour?

Thanks,
Joannie

Dear Dorothy:

Thank you very much for your note; below I have laid out the agenda for the
meeting for Ken and Jeff's approval:

1. Introduction to Adventis and our work in the Broad band space; - 20 minutes
2.  Ken's brief on Broad Band Services group's way forward: challenges,
issues, aspirations; - 15 minutes
3. Jeff's expectations and views form the corporate center;-10 minutes
4. Adventis' approach, likely routes to partnership;-10 minutes
5. Next steps: JEFF, KEN and our team.- 10/15 minutes

During the second hour with Ken, we wish to address specific points on the
out come of the first meeting to define areas of focus for path forward:

1 Strategic and operational issues for short term value creation, and
long-term robust development of BBS as global player
2. Acceleration capacity at BBS to capture short range opportunities versus
outside assistance.
3. Likely ways we could engage with Enron for both short term and long-term
wins.
4. Time line for creating the upside.

I am sure Ken and Jeff, will have a lot to add. Please do let me know.

Dorothy, given the significant challenges and opportunities ahead for Enron
BBS, we will have four of our senior most partners with deep insights into
Broad band and ASPs/CSPs join the meeting. I will come the night before, if
possible to have dinner with Jeff and/or Ken. Please do let me know the
possibility.

Regards,

Partha Ghosh
