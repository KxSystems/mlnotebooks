Dear Hilary,

The items Mr. Skilling purchased have arrived in Houston and I'm working with 
a customs broker to get them out of KLM Cargo.  The broker has indicated that 
the packing list and tax invoice are not descriptive enough to get the items 
out of customs, so I need to provide them with a detailed list of items, what 
they are made of and what he paid for them.  Unfortunately, Mr. Skilling is 
out of the country until January 2, 2001, and KLM will only hold these items 
until December 23 when they send them to some government warehouse.  If you 
could e-mail or fax me this information asap it is greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your assistance.

Regards,
Sherri Sera
