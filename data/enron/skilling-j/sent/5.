Awais,

Mr. Skilling receives this report every day, which he is very interested in=
=20
seeing; however, especially when traveling, he is most interested in the=20
summary e-mail, not the lengthy attached document.

I print this page for him everyday and fax it to him if traveling. =20
Unfortunately, there appears to be something in the margins that prevents t=
he=20
"To Date" column from printing.  Could you check into this and let me know =
if=20
there is something we can do to make certain that the entire e-mail page=20
prints?  Thanks for your assistance.  SRS
