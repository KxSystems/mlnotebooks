Thanks for the heads up, Micheal.  We're working to track down the source and

Subject: Bad Org Chart

Thought this might interest someone in the Executive Committee.

This org chart is obtained by Clicking Start/Programs/Enron Information/Enron 
Organization Chart.

Just don't want anyone to get bad information.  As far as I know, Rich Kinder 
is CEO of Kinder-Morgan which is the company I left to join Enron.
