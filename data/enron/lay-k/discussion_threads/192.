Dear Dad,

I just sent in an additional contribution to the Bush
Campaign and I put your number on the check, but I
want you to be aware so that you can assure it is
credited to your fundraising efforts.
Secondly, I've been doing a little more research on
the elusive Discover Communications, INC., my personal
dream company.
They are owned by: Liberty Media Corporations, Cox
Communications, Advance/ Newhouse Communications and
John S. Hendricks (who is the founder, Chairman and
CEO). If you know of any of the above companies or any
possible contact, I would greatly appreciate your
assistance. I am sending my resume to the Discover HR
people, but there are very few job postings and
anything I might be able to do to distinguish myself,
beyond of course my incredible experience, charm and
good nature, would be helpful!
Thanks Dad!
Love,
Elizabeth
