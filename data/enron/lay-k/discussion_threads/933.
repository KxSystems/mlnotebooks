Royal Carson of Carson Private Capital wanted to set-up a time to meet with 
you to give you an update on the two funds - Fund IV & Europe Fund.  I am 
going to go ahead and meet with him next week in Dallas since I will be there 
attending the Family Wealth Roundtable (11/16-17).  I will fill you in on our 
meeting.
