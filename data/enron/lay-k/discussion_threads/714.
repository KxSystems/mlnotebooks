Dear Dr. Lay:

The Globalist -- your daily online guide to the global
economy at http://www.TheGlobalist.com

+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-

GET YOUR GEOGRAPHY RIGHT!
Jakarta relocated to Washington, D.C.? Singapore
reunited with Malaysia?

We offer these and other geographical miscues in our
lament that, even in the era of globalization, geographic
education just ain't what it used to be.

VIRTUAL SOVEREIGNTY FOR JERUSALEM
If you start from the assumption that, one day, Israel and
Palestine have to learn to live with each other, can the
region's dot-coms provide a model for how to do it?

Find these stories at http://www.TheGlobalist.com.

Best wishes from Washington,

Stephan Richter
Publisher and Editor-in-Chief

THE SOYBEAN CONNECTION
Amid concerns over Chinese abuses of U.S. intellectual
property laws, Lester Brown of the Worldwatch Institute
recalls a time when the tables were turned.
