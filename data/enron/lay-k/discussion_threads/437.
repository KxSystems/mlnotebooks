Dear Ken:

News stories abound almost daily over the alleged need for
governments to proscribe various foods, beverages, cell phones, and
much more.  Yet, Americans are healthier and live longer than ever.
So, what is the real story here?

As a result, I am very pleased to invite you to attend the upcoming
Independent Policy Forum reception and seminar, "PUBLIC HEALTH vs.
THE NANNY STATE?"

http://www.independent.org/tii/forums/001026ipf.html

This program will feature syndicated columnist and Reason Magazine
senior editor, JACOB SULLUM, author of the book, FOR YOUR OWN GOOD,
and economist THOMAS DiLORENZO, co-author of the new book, FROM
PATHOLOGY TO POLITICS.

The program will be held Thursday evening, October 26th, from 6:30 to
8:30 p.m., at the Independent Institute's conference center in
Oakland, California.

For your review, I am adding below an invitation with further details
on the program.  Since seating is limited, please make your
reservations as soon as possible.  For further information, please
contact me or the Institute's Events Coordinator, Ms. Nichelle
Beardsley, at 510-632-1366 X118.

We hope to see you on October 26.

Sincerely,

David J. Theroux

PUBLIC HEALTH vs. THE NANNY STATE? -- Next Independent Policy Forum (10/26/00)
http://www.independent.org/tii/forums/001026ipf.html

Barely a day goes by without some news of the latest public health
"threat." Serious health hazards, we are told, lurk around every
corner -- in water supplies, air, soil, beverages, fast food,
second-hand smoke, cellular phones, and food irradiation, just to
name a handful. And yet, Americans today live longer than ever! Are
markets and private decision-making providing the answers? Or are
these dangers real, immediate, and a legitimate mandate for
government control? Can we reduce or eliminate health risks without
government dictates? How does politics distort perceptions about
public health? Will Americans succumb to or rebel against the growing
Nanny State's neo-Puritanism and attack on individual choice and
responsibility? JACOB SULLUM and THOMAS DiLORENZO will discuss these
timely and important issues.

About FOR YOUR OWN GOOD:

"Sullum is meticulously logical, and his conclusions are implicit in
everything he argues. FOR YOUR OWN GOOD has made us think about
totalitarianism in this most unlikely context."
      - NEW YORK TIMES

"Intriguing and worthwhile, this book marshals an impressive array of
facts and arguments. Thoughtful and articulate."
      - NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE

About FROM PATHOLOGY TO POLITICS: Public Health in America:

"FROM PATHOLOGY TO POLITICS argues that public health has become a
bureaucracy that feels the need to perpetuate itself by expanding
into new areas that are more often than not, just plain 'politically
correct.'"
      - WALL STREET JOURNAL
