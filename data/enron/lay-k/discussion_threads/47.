Hi Mr. Garten and Valerie -

We have been working on Ken's schedule.  It is a fairly busy week, but it 
looks like he could do a 30 minute conference call on Wed. at 2:30 p.m. (New 
York time), if that is still good for you.  Please let me know if Wednesday 
is a satisfactory time for the phone call.  That appears to be the only 
window he has next week.

Valerie had already sent the SEC Panel Outline on 4/11, which you attached 
below.  Ken Lay has already seen it.

Re:  the other question that you asked about Ken Lay's name appearing in a 
press release, he said that is fine.

Rosalee

Dear Ken,

We are in the process of trying to arrange a conference call with you on
either Tuesday or Wednesday of next week to discuss the paper which is
attached.  ( I'm sending it along now so that you have some time to look at
it.)

We will be doing this by conference call and once we set a time to talk with
you, will give you the number to call.  (To set up a time, your office can
contact my assistant, Valerie Petersen either at valerie.petersen@yale.edu
or at 203-432-6035.)

Look forward to speaking with you next week.

Best regards,
Jeff Garten
