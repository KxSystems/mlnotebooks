Mary,  the Corporate Secretary database was wrong! following is the correct 
information:

 7/9/85  President & COO
 11/11/85 President & CEO
 2/11/86  Chairman, President, & CEO
 10/10/90 Chairman & CEO
 
Brieft history lesson on name changes: 

Name Changes: 04/25/30 Northern Natural Gas Company 
              03/28/80 InterNorth, Inc. 
              04/10/86 Enron Corporation 
              04/17/86 Enron Corp. 

InterNorth, Inc. and Houston Natural Gas Corporation (HNG) were competitors 
until InterNorth Holdings Incorporated (IHI), a Texas corporation and a 
wholly-owned subsidiary of InterNorth, Inc., purchased for cash all HNG stock 
pursuant to 5/2/85 Agreement and Plan of Merger (filed and effective in Texas 
7/16/85); HNG surviving corporation.  HNG stock ceased to exist and IHI's 
stock was converted into new HNG stock,  making HNG wholly-owned subsidiary 
of Enron Corp. after merger.
