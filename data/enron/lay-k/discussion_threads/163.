Forum 2000 starts in just a few days.  We are expecting over
1,500 people from over 80 nations to attend the event, from
Heads of State to grass-roots organizers, from business
executives to spiritual leaders, and from senior statesmen to
youth. For the first time ever, all the stakeholders in the
debate over globalization will be coming to the same place at
the same time for interactive dialogue.

THERE ARE STILL A FEW SEATS LEFT AT THE TABLE.

JOIN US.
