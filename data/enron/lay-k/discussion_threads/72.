Dad,
Just wanted to give you some more to think about. What
I would really like to find is a job that combines my
interest in politics, my legislative skills, with my
passion for marine conservation.  This can expand to
environmental conservation.

The number one corporate target for me is the
Discovery Channel in Miami. They do have a fairly
significant office there and I am going to try and
make contacts at Discovery.

One option I am considering is working on the Bush
campaign from now until November in hopes during that
time I will make contacts in South Florida.
Unfortunately, they are not doing a significant amount
of work in South Florida.

I'll be around this weekend and would appreciate any
input.
I love you!
Elizabeth
