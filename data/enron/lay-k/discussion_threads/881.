It is my great pleasure to announce that the Board has accepted my=20
recommendation to appoint Jeff Skilling as chief executive officer, effecti=
ve=20
at the time of their next board meeting on February 12, 2001.  Jeff will al=
so=20
retain his duties as president and chief operating officer.  I will continu=
e=20
as chairman of the Board and will remain at Enron, working with Jeff on the=
=20
strategic direction of the company and our day-to-day global operations.

Jeff will assume the role at a time when the company is hitting on all=20
cylinders and is positioned for phenomenal growth.  He is clearly ready for=
=20
the job, and after 15 years as CEO of this great company, I=01,m ready for =
a=20
somewhat different role.

Our succession plan has been clear for some time.  This has afforded Jeff a=
nd=20
me the freedom to combine our strengths toward building a company that=20
continues to exceed everyone=01,s expectations, including our own.  We look=
=20
forward to furthering that relationship as Jeff expands his role.

There are no plans for any other changes in our management team nor broad=
=20
shifts in strategy and direction.

Please join me in congratulating Jeff.  I look forward to a great 2001.
