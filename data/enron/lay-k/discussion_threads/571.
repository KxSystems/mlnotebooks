It is time to get together again. November 2nd is the first Thursday of
the month and Arcadoro's is holding our table from 6:00 PM to 7:30 PM. If
you have not joined us at this location, you should give it a try. The
food is great and the company cannot be beat! The address is 5000
Westheimer. This is the corner of Westheimer and Post Oak (the NW corner
of the intersection). It is located below Morton's Steakhouse and valet
parking is complementary.

If you need further directions or have any questions about our get
together, please check out the chapter's web site at
http://users.netropolis.net/bayoucitytigers/.

The Bayou City Tigers joined our sister alumni clubs in Austin to watch
Mizzou play the Longhorns. While we hoped for a different result, it was
still a great opportunity to commune with fellow Tigers. Just like our
Casual Conversations.

If you need information, please feel free to call any of the Board of
Directors (phone numbers are on the web site) or email Bob Hanson:
txhansons@aol.com

Suggestions or feedback is always welcome. See you on Thursday.
