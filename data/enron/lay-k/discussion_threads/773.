Chairman John Quain of the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission needs to
speak with Chairman Lay at his earliest convenience.

Mr. Quain would like to discuss a confidential matter concerning national
energy policy.  Mr. Quain is currently in South America with Governor Ridge
of Pennsylvania on a trade mission.

Mr. Quain would be available after 1:00 p.m. CST, tomorrow, Thursday, or
Friday at the latest for this conference call.  We will handle the logistics
of the call.

Kindly call me at (717) 783-8021, my direct line number, if Chairman Lay can
accommodate this request.

Thank you for your kind consideration.

Dennis J. Buckley
Counsel to the Chairman
