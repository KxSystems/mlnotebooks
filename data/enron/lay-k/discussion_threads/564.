Dear Mr. Lay and Mr. Skilling:

We launched a new product this month called the Enron "Global Markets 
Monitor", which will be published each week by my team in the Country Risk 
and Foreign Exchange department within Vince Kaminski's Research Group.  We 
thought you might find our publication informative.  The most recent Global 
Markets Monitor is attached below.  This product was specifically designed to 
serve Enron's needs by helping the traders and business units stay abreast of 
international events that can have an impact on their profits and 
strategies.  This publication allows these groups to focus on their core 
businesses yet stay current on important developments in the global financial 
and commodity markets.  Special emphasis is placed on potential central bank 
policy changes and the impact these changes have on interest rates and 
currencies.  The weekly publication is available on our web site, by 
selecting the "Global Markets Monitor" link under the spinning "NEW":
