We are already receiving several inquiries regarding the upcoming
Presidential Inauguration.  Enclosed is information pertaining to everything
from hotel accommodations and travel to the Texas State Society Black Tie
and Boots Inaugural Ball, which is the official Presidential Inaugural Ball
for the State of Texas.

Furthermore, I would like you to notice that several of the hotels in
Washington, DC are not taking reservations until November 8, 2000.  In order
to reserve a room for the Inauguration, you might want to begin calling
hotels at the open of business on that day.  You will find a compiled list
of many hotels on pages four through six in the attached information.
Please make a note that most hotels require a minimum length of stay of four
nights.  You will want to plan accordingly.

In addition, I do not recommend that you rent a vehicle during your stay.
Due to the large number of people in Washington at this time, driving will
be next to impossible.  It is in your best interest to utilize the Metro
system or to take a cab.

I hope you find the enclosed to be useful.  Please feel free to call my
office at 202.225.2231 or email Jenny Sheffield at
jenny.sheffield@mail.house.gov if there is anything else that I can do to be
of assistance.  I look forward to seeing you in January!

Sincerely,
Pete Sessions
Member of Congress
