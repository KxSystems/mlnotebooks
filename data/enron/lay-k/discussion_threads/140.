portion of the Prime Minister's visit to the United States are being 
finalized.? We have had to work around the schedules of U.S. Commerce 
Secretary Norman Mineta, who is leaving for Chicago mid-afternoon, and Prime 
MInister Vajpayee, who is busy until the late afternoon.? Here is the updated 
agenda.? :
