Rep. Archer did a great job today filming the spot.  Fyi, we will put it up 
on Thursday and hold a news conference that same day with  four Republican 
state reps and preview the spot for TV and the  chronicle.
?
Would you send Archer a short note thanking  him, Sharon and Don Carlson, his 
aide, for their excellent  effort?
?
Thanks. Everything is good. Our four day tracking  poll (we are tracking 
every night except friday and saturday) shows us  up 59-34. Give the 
opponents all the undecided and we are still in  shape to coast in 55-45--a 
20 point turnaround from  '99.
