Ken, while the  speculation is running rampant on your possible role in the 
Bush administration,  I just wanted to say that,?we would hate to lose you as 
the "go to "leader  here in Houston, the country, Houston, the Partnership, 
and the business  community would be well served by your inclusion in the 
Bush  administration....
?
Not that I have a  right to be, I would be "right proud" for you to represent 
Houston in the White  House.
Happy  holidays!
Jim
