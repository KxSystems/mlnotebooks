Ken:

Rosie has marked your calendar for Wednesday December 13th to attend a 
luncheon and speech at the Hyatt Downtown in the Lay Lecture Series.

Barton Smith of UH will share the results of the economic study he is 
co-directing on the costs and benefits of the Houston region complying with 
the TNRCC SIP for ozone.  (This is the Greater Houston Partnership study I 
have told you about.)  Dr. George Tolley of the University of Chicago will 
also be present for the question and answer period.

I will give you more information as the event approaches.

- Rob
