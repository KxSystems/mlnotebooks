Hi Liz -

I had a very interesting conversation with Rocky.  He is still in business, 
just finishing up boots for the new President.    Also, I have been called 
"Precious" and "Baby" this morning.  Somehow, it just seems appropriate from 
him!!

He is located at RJ's Boot Company and Shoe Shop
3321 Ella Blvd. & 34th Street
Houston, Texas  77018

Phone:  713-682-1650, fax 713-682-5520
