Dear Family and Friends,
Ken and I just cut short our Italy trip with friends to return to Houston
for the birth of our 6th grandchild (which is the final one for this round
of four pregnancies).  We were happy to return home and I am a very thankful
and thrilled grandmother (aka Momie, Mamamia, Mamia, Mia).  This was the
first live birth that I have personally witnessed since my last baby, Beau,
and it was VERY exhilarating and VERY emotional, as evidenced by the
attached photos.  I hope you will enjoy seeing my new grandson "Pate David
Herrold" (Pate was Courtney's maiden name) who was born on June 8, 2000 at
7:19 p.m.  Pate was 7 lbs, 10 ozs, 20 inches long with a lot of dark curly
hair.  I think he looks exactly like David at birth, but time will tell.
These photos were taken in the delivery room within the first 15-20 minutes
of his birth prior to being cleaned up and returned to the nursery.  He
looks pretty darn good for just having arrived into this world with such
great force.  So far, he is a VERY calm and good infant just like his Daddy
was.  Enjoy!  Big kiss and lots of love, LPL
