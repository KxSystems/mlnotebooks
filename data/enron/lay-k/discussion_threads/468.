A New Era in Taiwan's Democracy
Monday, October 23, 2000
9:00 a.m - 3:00 p.m.
Wohlstetter Conference Center
Twelfth Floor, AEI

On May 20, Taiwan entered a new era of democracy as the torch of government 
was passed from a ruling party that has governed for the past 50 years to the 
opposition.  In the spirit of cooperation and amity, the new president 
appointed a KMT member to be his premier and sought to create an "all 
people's government" composed of both ruling and opposition party members.  
But that experiment ended when the premier resigned on October 3 due to bad 
health.  Now, with both a DPP president and a DPP premier at the helm, Taiwan 
enters a new era of governance and party politics.  How will this impact the 
political environment in Taiwan?  Will U.S.-Taiwan relations be affected?
