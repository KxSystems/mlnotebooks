Economic/General News
October 11: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has forecasted 
slower-than-expected economic growth and left lending rates unchanged in its 
half-yearly report. The RBI governor said economic growth in the fiscal year 
ending March 2001 was likely to be closer to 6% instead of earlier 
projections of up to 7%. He said the slowdown was partly because of the 
floods that devastated sections of India -- most recently in West Bengal. 
Inflation also rose by more than 0.5%, a trend attributed to the substantial 
rises in international oil prices in the past year. BBC World Service <

oil prices on the government's fiscal deficit, given the system of 
subsidizing certain petroleum products. In addition, Moody's may also review 
their "positive" rating soon. The Economic Times <
