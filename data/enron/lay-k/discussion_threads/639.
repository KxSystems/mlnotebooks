Ken: Please note that Mr. Lars Uno Thulin has asked to meet with Bob Fisher 
of Hills and Company and I on Friday, December 1 while we are in Oslo to 
promote our campaign to get energy services support in the WTO. This meeting 
and others in Brussels and Dusseldorf earlier that week had been requested by 
the USTR as part of the grass roots outreach program. Considerable support 
for energy services has been building according to USTR although our own 
people indicated to Bob Fisher and me several days ago that Enron may not 
want to provide funding for the Energy Services Coaltion beyond December. 
Further, with my pending retirement in March, there is a question as to who 
from industry will lead the coaltion. Bob Fisher gave Rick a paper on 
developments and funding for the future although I submitted in my 2001 
budget proposal fully funding the effort.

Do you have any advice regarding a possible meeting with Mr. Thulin?

Joe

PS Perhaps you have seen my letter to Boyden Gray indicating an interest in a 
position in a Bush Administration. I also indicated my interest in assiting 
Boyden in his transition work.

Dear Joe Hillings,

Please find enclosed a draft programme for your visit to Oslo. It is meant
as a proposal only, and we would like to hear your comments, and how this
might suit your needs and wishes. May I add a few practical and explanatory
points:
* I understand that you will be coming in on Wednesday afternoon. From
the Airport there is an express train that takes you to the down town area
in less than 20 minutes, considerably quicker than by car. I would be happy
to meet you at the Grand Hotel in the evening for an informal talk, unless
you have other plans. I would also be happy to accompany you  throughout the
programme.
* The people that you will meet in the MFA will basically be those
dealing with the WTO-negotiations, and who are all familiar with the
proposals on energy services. So we could talk on how to deal with the issue
in the ongoing and coming negotiations.
* You will meet key personalities in the Ministry for oil and energy
* Director General Arne Walther is host for a luncheon - he is
currently holding the positions as Chairman of the Board of the
International Energy Agency (IEA)
* You are invited as Key Note Speakers at a workshop on energy
services in the house of The Federation of Norwegian Business and Industry,
which will invite a selected group of leading personalities throughout the
energy business sector in Norway.
* I understand that you will host a dinner in the evening; I would be
happy to advise you on participants, as appropriate; I presume that you ,
i.a., will invite representatives from your company and the US Embassy
* I talked to the CEO of STATKRAFT, Mr. Lars Uno Thulin, who is a good
friend of mine, and who also is well acquainted with the President of Enron,
Mr. Ken Lay. He would appreciate an opportunity for a private conversation,
and suggests a breakfast Friday morning as an option. Please let me know if
this is possible.

I wish you and Bob Fisher very welcome to Oslo!

Yours sincerely

Torbj"rn Fr"ysnes

  Dear Ambassador Froysnes:

  I called this morning to introduce myself and to see how we
should proceed
  to extend invitations to attendees at our workshop and lunch
at the Grand
  Hotel in Oslo, Thursday, November 30th. Bob Fisher, trade
counsel to the
  Energy Services Coalition and I will be arriving in Oslo the
evening of
  Wednesday, November 29th and staying until the morning of
Friday, December
  1st. We would be pleased to host you and guests of your
choice for dinner
  either Wednesday or Thursday evening.

  I would be most grateful if you could advise if you have
already begun to
  invite participants for our workshop and lunch on Thursday,
November 30 or
  if I should undertake that task under your direction.

  Regards,

  Joe
