=20
newsletter, which is circulated currently to the London, Oslo, Frankfurt,=
=20
Madrid, Moscow, Geneva, Helsinki, Singapore, Warsaw, Teesside and Stockholm=
=20
offices, is a mix of Enron Europe business highlights, notable quotes about=
=20
Enron in the press and other general items of interest on activities in the=
=20
London office and throughout Europe. =20

Please notify Tracy Ralston on +44-20-7783-6611 or by e-mail, if you would=
=20
like to receive a copy of this newsletter and be added to the regular=20
distribution list.  A copy of the most recent newsletter, which is called=
=20
EuroFlash!, is below for your review.







BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Enron Metals Branding
Work to re-position MG as Enron Metals is well underway in the UK and will=
=20
shortly be underway at Enron Metals offices around the world.  Any member o=
f=20
staff who has a question about branding or name changes should contact Fion=
a=20
Grant in Public Relations.

Croatia
The mid-term power sales agreement between Enron and Croatian utility HEP i=
s=20
due to be signed tomorrow (Wednesday) at an official ceremony and press=20
conference in Zagreb.  Enron is also participating in the annual Zagreb Tra=
de=20
Fair this week.

EBS
Enron Broadband Ventures (EBV), the investment arm of Enron Broadband=20
Services, announced its first investment in Europe this week.  As part of a=
=20
consortium of venture capital funds, EBV is helping provide development=20
funding for Interxion, a Dutch Internet infrastructure provider.  Interxion=
=20
operates a growing number of carrier-neutral Internet exchanges (IECs) in=
=20
Europe and is planning to develop new centres in Madrid, Milan, Zurich,=20
Munich, Helsinki and at Hilversum in the Netherlands.  "This investment is=
=20
part of our strategy to invest in emerging communications and technology=20
companies where EBV can leverage EBS's knowledge and resources" explained=
=20
Andrew Marsden, European Head of Enron Broadband Ventures.


A TECHNOLOGY UPDATE FROM IT'S MARK PICKERING. . .

Sametime, a new communication tool, is coming to screens across Europe and,=
=20
in the future, throughout Enron's offices worldwide.   What is Sametime? It=
's=20
a simple tool that integrates with Lotus Notes to allow you to send and=20
receive text messages to/from Enron colleagues. Sametimeis not a replacemen=
t=20
for email or the phone, but rather it should complement both exiting=20
communication tools. This is a tool that will be of most value to people wh=
o=20
spend a lot of time at their PC, but who want to ask a question of someone,=
=20
conduct a simple conversation or send a message in real time, without havin=
g=20
to pick up the phone or compose an email message.
Sametimegives users instant messaging capabilities. The green square tells=
=20
you who is online and able to receive a message, while the red dot gives a=
=20
simple indication of people who may be away from their desk (see screen=20
sample below).
I use the system everyday and find it invaluable in communicating with my=
=20
team. It also comes into its own when communicating with people in other=20
offices, especially Houston (you can even use it on the road!). A nice=20
feature is that you can fire off a message to someone and know it will sit =
on=20
their screen until they read it.  Sametime'susefulness falls under the=20
=01+Network=01, effect, i.e. the more people online, the greater the benefi=
t.
Sametime will be available on your desktop in the not too distant future, s=
o=20
watch out for further details.  Looking forward to sametiming with you soon=
!

ENRON NIGHT AT THE RACES MAKES AN IMPACT IN THE COMMUNITY

Last month the Enron Social Committee hosted an evening at the Greyhound=20
Races in Wimbledon.  The proceeds of the evening, combined with a 'matching=
'=20
donation from Enron, raised o1,600 for The Battersea Dogs' Home.  With the=

charity spending an average o530 per dog that comes into the home, the mone=
y=20
was gratefully received by BDH.  Thanks to all who helped make a difference=
