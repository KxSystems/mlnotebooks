Dear Mr. Lay,=20

Re: International Coalition for IT =01) Central Chapter 1st Meeting,? Board=
room,=20
????? Hilton Hotel, Munich City, Monday 30th Oct. 2000=20

As you may aware, the international community (namely : G8, World Bank, UN,=
=20
WTO, etc,) is currently working towards assisting the developing countries =
in=20
bridging the existing digital-divide. In catalysing and also making these=
=20
efforts more penetrative, there is an urgent necessity for a combined,=20
practical but localised initiative that will directly? encourage and enable=
=20
the full participation of the stakeholders within these countries in the ne=
w=20
economy.=20

In this way, we are planning to set-up a company-led initiative in the name=
=20
of? =01&International Coalition for IT", starting with Africa. The proposed=
=20
coalition is a special strategy for bridging digital-divide with developing=
=20
countries on one hand; and on the other hand, it is another way for the=20
participating companies to gain competitive edge in these emerging markets=
=20
and also to strengthen them towards working with the international communit=
y=20
as well as the governments and notable stakeholders in these developing=20
countries, on IT matters.=20

The first meeting of the central chapter of this initiative will be coming =
up=20
soon in Germany. Among others, this important meeting is expected to produc=
e=20
the ICOIT Implementation Strategies through the integration of perspectives=
=20
of the participating companies, being company-led initiative. It is intende=
d=20
that these implementation? strategies will be applied globally by way of=20
adaptation from one continent to another, as the initiative grows.=20

Given your 'Broadband Services', perhaps Enron would like to participate in=
=20
this initiative and may be you would also like your perspective to be a par=
t=20
of these fundamental strategies. In this connection, it is my pleasure=20
inviting your company to this meeting. In case you are interested, kindly l=
et=20
me know at your earliest convenience; so as to facilitate our arrangements.=
=20

I am attaching the concept of the initiative and the meeting=01,s tentative=
=20
agenda for your information. In case you have any question, please feel fre=
e=20
to contact me.=20

Best regards.=20
