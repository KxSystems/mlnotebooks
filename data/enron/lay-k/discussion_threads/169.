		 Subject: nCUBE/Blockbuster/Enron News Release - DRAFT

Attached is a press release announcing the selection of nCUBE as the video 
streaming platform for the Blockbuster entertainment on-demand service.  I 
apologize for the quick turnaround, but we just received approval from nCUBE 
and Blockbuster.  It will be issued tomorrow prior to the IBC conference in 
Amsterdam where Enron and Blockbuster are exhibiting with nCUBE.

Please let me know if you have any comments by 5:00 p.m. today.  Thanks.
