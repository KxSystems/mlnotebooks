Dear Rosalie--I am forwarding two attachments from the previous email again,
as background for Ken Lay.  It appears that the documents were converted
into an unreadable format at the receiving end, so I am sending them in a
new format to ensure that they arrive intact.

Thanks for your assistance, and we certainly hope that Mr. Lay will be able
to join us for the Highlands Forum. Please contact me for any questions that
may arise.

Best regards, Dick O'Neill

Dick O'Neill
Director
