Tomorrow is the first Thursday of the month and time for the Bayou City
Tigers to meet. Join us at Arcadoro's from 6:00 PM to 7:30 PM to socialize
with other Mizzou grads. The food is great and the company cannot be beat!
The address is 5000 Westheimer. This is the corner of Westheimer and Post
Oak (the NW corner of the intersection). It is located below Morton's
Steakhouse and valet parking is complementary.

If you need further directions or have any questions about our get
together, please feel free to check out the web site at
http://users.netropolis.net/bayoucitytigers/ where you can locate
information on our chapter and its activities.

The Bayou City Tigers will have a new location for Casual Conversations in
January and a different day of the month. A Founder's Day celebration in
February in concert with a Watch Party. We want to invite prospective new
Mizzou students as well. If you need information, please feel free to call
any of the Board of Directors (phone numbers are on the web site) or email
me. We will do a mailer as well but ask for your help in calling all of
the alumni in our area to get the word out.

A suggestion or feedback is always welcome. Hope to see you Thursday.
