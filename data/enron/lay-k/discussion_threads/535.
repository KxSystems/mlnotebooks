Here what they have actually bought:

23,700    11
22,995    13
  9,100    2
  6,900    26
62,695    Total.

They've told the stations that they expect to add time to the buy. But that
will be very difficult for them to do next week and it will not be all that
much any way.

The Carson "Group" is a one man operation out of a cat ridden house
somewhere out west.

Our in-house media guy says the TV is being placed by the Carson Group. The
Tv stations have said they will not tell us how much has been spent on the
buy over the phone, but they will show us in person if we send someone to
the stations. Have you found out any more information?
