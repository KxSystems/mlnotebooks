Dear Ken:

This is a brief note to thank you for taking the time to serve as a
reference for me.  Your continued support of both my professional and
personal development is deeply appreciated.  You are a fine role model and
someone who continues to inspire me to strive further.

I have taken a job as President and CEO of ChainDrugStore.net, a web based
B2B information exchange.  We are based in Alexandria, Va.  My boss and
Chairman of our Board is Craig Fuller.  You may remember that Craig was Vice
President Bush's Chief of Staff.

Let's keep our fingers crossed on GW--looks good, but too close for comfort.
I keep in regular touch with my friends Larry Lindsey, Bob Grady and Bob
Zoellick--understand they serve on an advisory board for Enron.

Ken, thanks again for everything and keep my ESOP investment growing.

Best,

Brad Mitchell
