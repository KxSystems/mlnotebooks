Hello Mr. Lay,

It's been a long time since we've talked.  I'm Priscilla Slade, President of
Texas Southern University.  The primary purpose of this e-mail is to invite
you to attend a weekend at the home of President and Mrs. Bush September
16-18.  So many people have expressed a desire to  know more about the
University (it's new initiatives and successes) that  President Bush
volunteered to host a gathering of 25 CEOs and spouses (or a second person
in the corporate hierarchy).  In addition to having fun golfing, sailing,
boating, etc., we are presenting ALL YOU WANT TO KNOW ABOUT TEXAS SOUTHERN
UNIVERSITY.

The tentative schedule of events is as follows:
Saturday September 16 - Fun activities (sailing, boating, golf, etc.)
Sunday September 17 ---- Reception and dinner at the home of President and
Mrs. Bush
Monday Morning ------------ ALL YOU WANT TO KNOW ABOUT TSU
Monday afternoon ---------- Return to Houston

I know TSU is your favorite topic and we look forward to you joining us.  An
invitation is in the mail.  I will call you when you return.

Priscilla
