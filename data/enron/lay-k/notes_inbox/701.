Bobbie,
We have finally been able to track down a resume for Nelson Steele.  Based 
upon his resume he is not someone we would have invited to interview for the 
Analyst Program.  We have also spoken to the Portland Office regarding the 
interview that Nelson had with them.  According to Amy Fitzpatrick, the HR 
Rep in Portland, when he interviewed he was extremely unimpressive.  
Consequently, he was not extended an offer by the Portland Office.  When they 
called to tell him such, his response was, "that's OK because I did not want 
to work there anyway."

I am doubtful that he will fare well in the interview process but will bring 
him in if that is what is desired.  Please let me know how you wish for us to 
proceed.  Thanks.
Charlene

Charlene I recently sent you a copy of a memo from Henry B. Steele - U of H 
letterhead  regarding a gentleman by the name of Nelson who interviewed as a 
day trader in Portland.  Mr. Lay's message was such  for us to follow up with 
this.  Would you please let me or Cindy know the status of this memo.

Thanks Charlene for your help.

Bobbie
