My interests are primarily business development.  Although an engineer by
training, I have been in the business and operations side for the last 20
years.  My main area has been natural resources and energy.  I also enjoy
strategy work, and apparently am good at it, judging by the results from the
international plan I did as the first ever VP, International at Westcoast
Energy.

> One item of note regarding project feasibility - while I ran Westcoast
> Energy's Asia business development and operations, we invested (with
> partners) over $600 MM US in five years with a total staff of 5 (including
> clerical), and a write-off rate of 0.14% of capital invested - possibly a
> record low.   I have good systems for risk review and mitigation, and  to
> screen projects, countries, partners, and  agents.
>
> The contracts I have been working on in Mexico are Pemex contracts, but
> are similar to the contracts used by CFE for IPPs, and drafted by the same
> law firm,  if Rosarito is any example.  Having worked on $60 MM claims
> under these contracts, I am very familiar with the problems that these
> contracts have, the various possible interpretations, and the possible
> "fixes".   If, as I suspect, Enron are interested in more power
> development in the rapidly expanding/opening Mexican IPP market, I believe
> I could offer solid advice on the contracts, the players, and the risks.

I would appreciate if you could circulate this note and my CV to the
appropriate parties in Enron.
