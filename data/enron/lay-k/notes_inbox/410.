I am one of Annat Jain=01,s girlfriends.  I need to bring some stark facts =
to
your attention.  Annat Jain, a senior director of communications at Enron
India, boldly and shamelessly continues to set an example of =01&Ethical
misconduct=018 and is risking the integrity of your organization in India a=
s a
whole.  This has been going on for the last 18 months!  While staying on
Enron=01,s payroll, he boldly demonstrates conflict of interest by spending
most of his time at his other private ventures (RazorFinish.com and
Powervertical.com).

Since apparently he enjoys the CEO=01,s friendship, he feels that he can wa=
lk
over anyone at anytime.  He is very abusive right from the office boy to th=
e
senior staff and openly boasts about his arrogance and attitude.  Respect
towards others does not even cross his arrogant and rude self.  If one
audits the last 18 months of credit card charges, purchases and other
expenses, most of these charges are being made for his 2 private ventures
(RazorFinish.com and Powervertical.com) or personal entertainment.

To go totally overboard with his bold denial of ethics and company
standards, he is now in the process of hiring and acquiring some individual=
s
from his 2nd venture (Powervertical.com) into Enron!  He also boasts openly
that Enron India will soon acquire his company Powervertical.com so he can
gain financially from such a transaction.  Thus, he continues to use Enron
as a platform for his personal gains.  It is indeed a shame that such an
individual represents your organization in the marketplace and industry.  A
lot of the industry experts are aware of Annat=01,s unethical behavior and =
his
rude attitude in general dealings and have refused to work with Enron as
such.  What example will he set for the organization as a whole and how lon=
g
will you tolerate such behavior?
