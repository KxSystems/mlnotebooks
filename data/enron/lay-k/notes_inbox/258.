STATE SIDE=20
VISION & LEADERSHIP FOR THE 77TH LEGISLATIVE SESSION: Recalling Governor Bu=
sh=01,
s emphasis on limited government, Tony pressed for a highly focused=20
legislative agenda for the Railroad Commission.? Garza told his fellow=20
commissioners that =01) as Governor Bush is fond of saying =01) =01&you can=
 have so=20
many priorities that you really don=01,t have any priorities=018 and urged =
the=20
Commission to concentrate resources and energy primarily in two critical=20
areas:=20

In His Own Words=01(.On Sunset Review: =01&From my perspective, there=01,s =
no doubt=20
our agency is just as relevant today as we were in 1891, but our job is to=
=20

re=20
this agency is headed in the future. =01&? Tony serves as the agency=01,s p=
oint=20
person for the Railroad Commission=01,s Sunset Review.=20

On Budget: Simply put, budget is policy.? There=01,s no clear statement of =
what=20
we consider important than our budget.? I want to focus on issues of=20
salaries, equipment upgrades and replacements, as well as increased=20
technology =01) each will help us meet our core mission responsibilities.=
=018?? The=20
Commission passed their Fiscal Year 2001 budget on August 8th.=20

 Tony has focused=20
on what he likes to call =01&the Three E=01,s=018 =01) energy, environment =
and=20
efficiency.? He continues to press for policy and programs that keep those=
=20
three areas in mind.=20

Energy: Tony believes incentives to production should remain a priority,=20
including incentives for new drilling through severance tax credits and=20
exemptions in certain cases.=20

On the natural gas front, rising prices and tightening supplies were the=20
focus of Tony=01,s recent letter to state and federal leaders.? With natura=
l gas=20
price hitting an all-time high, it=01,s estimated that the average Texas=20
household could see a 55 percent increase in their home heating bills this=
=20
winter.? To minimize the impact of such an increase, Tony offered some=20
practical advice for Texans.? Read about it at=20
http://www.rrc.state.tx.us/commissioners/garza/garza.html.=20

Environment: Tony continues to lead the charge for stronger protection of o=
ur=20
state=01,s natural resources =01) especially water.? In the 77th Legislativ=
e=20
Session, Tony wants to build upon the Commission=01,s commitment to the=20
preservation of Texas=01, natural resources by refining methods to increase=
=20
funding for the state=01,s Oil Field Clean-up Fund.=20

Tony also wants to ensure that Texas is safe for us and for future=20
generations.? You may have seen reports of the pipeline explosion in Abilen=
e=20
or coverage of the proposed Longhorn Pipeline in Central Texas.? Both are=
=20
examples of the public and media becoming more concerned with pipeline=20
safety.? Tony believes that we can do more with the state=01,s One Call (=
=01&Call=20
Before You Dig=018) System and wants to see enforcement and fines brought u=
p to=20
National Best Practices standards.=20

Efficiency: This year, the Commission rolled out the first stage of its=20
Electronic Compliance and Approval Program =01) allowing Texas oil and gas=
=20
producers to begin filing some permits online and moving the agency one ste=
p=20
closer to being a paperless environment.=20

Additionally, the Railroad Commission showed off its new web page=20
(http://www.rrc.state.tx.us) which touts a much more user-friendly format a=
nd=20
will allow the Commission to put more information online for its customers=
=20
and the people of Texas.=20

Finally, Tony found support from his fellow Commissioners for a Railroad=20
Commission Web Site Kids=01, Page, where Texas schoolchildren can learn mor=
e=20
about the history and importance of the oil and gas industry to Texas, as=
=20

ion=20

ing=20
2001.=20

These projects, coupled with the Railroad Commission=01,s request to the=20
Legislature for technology and equipment upgrades, mean that the Railroad=
=20
Commission will move even closer to being a truly e-government agency with=

greater online accessibility and offerings.=20
