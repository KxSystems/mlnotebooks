Subject: Forum Topic - HALFTIME & BEYOND



Just a few notes to give some thought to before attending our meeting this 
evening.






HALFTIME - an interval in a person's life where he or she explores ways to 
transform their success into significance.



What is it that you have always wanted to do?  And why haven't you done it 
yet?






HALFTIME DRILL:

 Answer the following questions to help you take stock of your first half as 
you prepare for a better second half.  Be honest, and write down your answers.

1) What do I want to be remembered for? Write a description of how your life 
would look if it turned out just the way you wished.

2) What about money?
How much is enough?
If I have more than enough, what purpose do I serve with the excess?
If I have less than enough, what am I willing to do to correct that?

3) How am I feeling about my career now?
Is this what I want to be doing with my life ten years from now?

4) Am I living a balanced life?
What are the important elements in my life that deserve more time?

5) What is the primary loyalty in my life?

6) Where do I look for inspiration, mentors and working models for my second 
half?

7) Peter Drucker says that two important needs are self-realization and 
community.  On a scale of 1-10 (10 being the highest), how am I doing in 
these areas?

8) Draw a line that describes the ups and downs of your life.  Or draw three 
lines, one for personal life, one for family life, and one for work life.  
Where do they intersect?  Where do they diverge?

9) Which of the following transition options seems to fit my temperament and 
gifts best?
(Evaluate each option on a sale of 1-10)
a. Keep on doing what I already do well, but change the environment.
b. Change the work, but stay in the same environment.
c. Turn an avocation into a new career.
d. Double-track (or even triple-track) in parallel careers (not hobbies).
e. Keep on doing what I'm doing, even past retirement age.

10) What do I want for my children?
