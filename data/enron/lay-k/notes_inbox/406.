The following would be too logical not to be in practice now, I could not 
post to E-think.

The Power Company Name Recognition - Introduce Home Coupons

Make the internet profitable to households.  Newspapers advertise that this 
week's Sunday paper has coupons that will save you $100.00.

Go one step better:

Every household must eat.  Some households buy the Sunday newspaper just for 
the coupons to purchase.  Offer a Enron site where producers can post 
manufacturer's coupons on The Enron B2B web page.  If the consumer downloads 
the coupon, TPC records the transaction including the consumer's logon site 
and Zip Code.  Sell the database to the manufacturer/producer.  Ask the 
consumer if they would like direct solicitations for competitor's brand.  
Expand it to appliances and manufacturer's coupons.

Then Link local grocery/appliance stores, for the consumer, by his 
surrounding zip code.  The stores would post their price for that month's 
coupon by store zip code on the B2B.  For those stores participating, prepare 
a comparison by store also considering double and triple coupon offers and 
the consumer can make a decision where to buy their groceries.  Sell the 
download to stores for expected inventory control.

If it takes off, I think internet volume would be tremendous and newspaper 
circulation??   McClere agreed that broadband won't take off until there is 
some kind of "killer application" to drive more people toward high-speed 
Internet access.
