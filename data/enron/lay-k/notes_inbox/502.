I KNOW this is becomming a pain .. but ....

We received a request from Pam Benson this morning to upgrade Mr. Sutton's 
laptop that he's been approved to take with him. He currently has  Toshiba 
Protege, and now he wants to return that and take an IBM X20 -- free of charge

I'll need approval from someone, please.

Thanks!

I just received a phone call from Pamela Benson 

Time -  10:18 
Wed November 1st
2000 

This was in regards to Mr. Suttons Laptop that was requested by him.  He 
would like to have the X20 Thinkpad ready by Nov 10th.  Pamela Benson had 
said that they where allowed to take this one free of Charge. (?????)  He 
will be turning in his Toshiba Protege's  both so the total amount of 
computers that will be in his possession will be 2 

1 X20      Suzanne Sutton 
1 X20     Joe Sutton

Please review so that if I have to ask Pam any question I will know what 
information is needed.  This request by Mr. Sutton need to fulfilled by Nov 
10th.  Do we need to make this an urgent issue and start setting this up if 
so I need to get the Laptop???? d
