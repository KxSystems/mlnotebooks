Re:            President Bush or President Gore?

Governor Bush and Secretary Cheney won on election night by getting
more votes in Florida than Gore/Lieberman.

Governor Bush and Secretary Cheney won when the election night vote
was confirmed by an official recount in Florida.

The only legitimate remaining ballots to be counted are those from Floridians
who reside overseas, who post-marked their ballots on or before November 7th,
and whose ballots are received on or before November 17th.

However, it is obvious that Gore/Lieberman are trying to steal the election.
Like the Clinton/Gore's years of public relations and legal distortions, 
Gore/Lieberman
are looking for a "governing legal authority" to increase their probability 
of victory.
They want four counties in Florida where Democrats significantly out-register 
Republicans
to hand-count their ballots; and let the Democrats in charge of the recounts 
"objectively"
decide what was in the mind of the voter when he/she did not completely punch 
the ballot.
For example, if someone partially punched a hole in a ballot because he/she 
started to vote
for Gore and then decided in the booth not to vote him or anyone, these 
Democrats would
give the vote to Gore - that's according to the second set of rules, as 
changed during the
recount in Palm Beach County.  Incidently, but not surprisingly, all three of 
these Palm
Beach officials are Democrats.

What Gore/Lieberman Campaign Chairman Richard Daley is orchestrating is as 
outrageous
as what his father did in 1960 in Cook County Illinois in stealing the 
election from John Kennedy.

Point blank, Al Gore is not as honorable as Richard Nixon was in 1960 and 
Gerald Ford was
in 1976 when both Republican candidates conceded the close elections despite 
campaign
advisors' requests for recounts.  They put the interests of the country ahead 
of their own
personal interest in the White House.  They knew then that recounting ad 
infinitum would
produce pluses and minuses in vote counts; but they trusted that the votes 
would balance
out if all precincts were recounted.  They believed in the integrity of our 
elections, and knew
of the adverse consequences here and abroad of second-guessing our election 
process.

If you are as upset as I am, then please help by making a contribution to the 
Bush/Cheney
Recount Fund that has been set up to fight the Gore/Lieberman trial lawyers 
and public
relations spin- miesters.

I am enclosing an admittedly less emotionally-charged letter from Bush/Cheney 
Campaign
Chairman Don Evans and a response form.  Please HELP TODAY.

           Chairman, Bush-Cheney Campaign

Date:  November 11, 2000

You were there when we began this campaign and we appreciate all that you have
done.  I would like to ask for your help one more time on behalf of Governor 
Bush
and Secretary Cheney.

It is now clear we must have the funding necessary to fight this legal battle 
in Florida.
Governor Bush won on Election Day, a victory confirmed by a recount.  Now, 
the other
side is seeking yet a third count by hand.

The law allows us to open a "recount fund" which we have done this morning.  
This
expensive legal process must be funded immediately.  We need you to overnight 
a check
for $5000, made payable to Bush-Cheney Recount.  Please see the delivery 
instructions
on the next page.

The check must come from personal funds.  No corporate contributions are 
allowed.
The contribution does not count against your annual federal giving limit of 
$25,000.
We are not required to make these donations public.  However, in keeping with 
Governor
Bush's "full disclosure" policy on financial contributions, these 
contributions will be posted
on the Bush-Cheney website.

We respectfully ask that you limit the amount of your check to $5000.  Should 
we have
funds left over, we will refund them to each donor on a pro rata basis.  If 
you have any
questions regarding this contribution, you may contact Jack Oliver or Jeanne 
Johnson
Phillips at (512) 344-4601.

Throughout the past two years, your friendship and support has meant a great 
deal to
Governor Bush and to me personally.  We thank you in advance for your 
willingness to
help us during this important time in the life of our country.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Warm regards.
