Hotze just bought TV. Looks like 125k total  for one week. Not certain. 
Cannot tell about complete buy since it isn't in the  public file.
?
Spot will run on 11 at 5,6, 10 news and  some on Letterman. 
?
Will consider response if spot seems to be  good. Tracking polls will follow.
?
I am putting Archer on Thursday ahead of  schedule to counter.
?
Will  advise.
