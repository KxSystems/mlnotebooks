This is a great time to be at Enron. The challenges and opportunities at=20
Enron seem to be expanding with every passing day.  This presents enormous=
=20
challenges for Government Affairs as a group and for each of us=20
individually.  As we discussed at the staff meeting last month, this requir=
es=20
us to constantly reevaluate our priorities, our methods of getting things=
=20
done, and whether our organization is properly structured to meet the needs=
=20
of the entire company.  While we have done an outstanding job as a group=20
within our current structure, changes are necessary at this time.

The primary change in the organizational structure is to complete the=20
assignments for and reinforce the leadership roles of the individuals withi=
n=20
the group who have primary responsibility for setting the Government Affair=
s=20
strategy and agenda for the respective Enron operating companies.  The belo=
w=20
mentioned individuals will have the following responsibilities:

1. Enron North America and Enron Industrial Markets:  Jim Steffes
2. The Enron Energy Services Group of Companies:  Harry Kingerski
3. Enron Broadband Services:  Sue Nord
4. Enron Global Markets and Enron Networks:  Lisa Yoho
5. Enron South America:  Jose Bestard
6. Federal Government Affairs:  Linda Robertson

With the impending retirement on March 31, 2001 of Joe Hillings, I am pleas=
ed=20
to announce that Linda Robertson will be joining the office on November 6,=
=20
2000, as a Vice President who will immediately assume responsibility for=20
leading the Federal Government Affairs group in our Washington office.  Lin=
da=20
was a Congressional staffer and partner/principal in two Washington law fir=
ms=20
prior to spending the last eight years with the U.S. Department of Treasury=
,=20
the last five as Assistant Secretary for Legislative Affairs and Public=20
Liaison, for Secretaries Rubin & Summers.  Linda brings a terrific=20
background, both in energy and financial services, and is a welcome additio=
n=20
to our team.  In order to more effectively integrate the Government Affairs=
=20
groups and strategy in Washington, the Federal Regulatory Affairs group und=
er=20
Joe Hartsoe=01,s direction will also report to Linda.  Joe Hartsoe will als=
o=20
retain primary responsibility for NERC activities, although Charles Yeung a=
nd=20
Dick Ingersoll will have a dotted line reporting relationship to Jim Steffe=
s=20
in his capacity of directing our activities for ENA.  Ray Alvarez will be=
=20
transferring from his current role with Transredes in Bolivia during the 1s=
t=20
quarter of 2001 and will join the Federal Regulatory Affairs group, reporti=
ng=20
to Joe Hartsoe.

On a personal note, I would like to acknowledge the significant contributio=
ns=20
that Joe Hillings has made to this company in his eighteen years of service=
. =20
Joe=01,s work ethic, intellect, and integrity have established Enron as a=
=20
company that is respected throughout Washington.  I will have more to say=
=20
about this as Joe=01,s retirement draws closer, but I look to him to be a v=
ital=20
part of the leadership transition in our Washington office that will occur=
=20
over the next days and weeks.

I will be relying heavily on the above-identified six individuals to ensure=
=20
that Government Affairs is firmly embedded within each of our operating=20
companies; that we as a group thoroughly understand their current business=
=20
strategies as well as new directions they may be taking in the future; and,=
=20
most importantly, to thoroughly understand how our organization can=20
contribute and add value to each of these companies on a continuing basis. =
=20
Communicating that understanding on a regular basis to the rest of the=20
Government Affairs organization and developing a Government Affairs wide=20
execution strategy will be a key objective for each of these individuals.

In order to ensure the success of these individuals and the Government=20
Affairs organization; the following changes are being made.

In addition to his leadership role with Government Affairs on behalf of the=
=20
EES group of companies, Harry Kingerski will continue to head up the=20
rates/regulatory group, now renamed Government Affairs Support Services.  =
=20
This group will continue to provide valuable technical support services=20
throughout Government Affairs and will be expanding its scope of expertise=
=20
over the next months to some of the new markets that the company has and wi=
ll=20
soon be entering.  Nancy Hetrick and Vinio Floris will join this organizati=
on=20
and report to Harry.
Jeff Brown, Tom Delaney, Mary Hain, Ron McNamara, Christi Nicolay, Thane=20
Twiggs, and Steve Walton will now report to Jim Steffes in his role=20
supporting Enron North America and Enron Industrial Markets. Alberto Levy=
=20
will be relocating from our Caracas, Venezuela office and will also report =
to=20
Jim.  A couple of special mentions:  Jeff Brown has done an outstanding job=
=20
in leading the CUBR (Coalition for Uniform Business Rules) process over the=
=20
last year and his current leadership of the Midwest ISO and Alliance RTO=20
efforts for Enron will be critical to the development of well functioning=
=20
wholesale electric markets in the U.S.  It is also my hope that Steve Walto=
n=20
will play an increased leadership role across North America on wholesale=20
electric market issues.  The incredible knowledge that Steve Walton possess=
es=20
of the electric industry, coupled with his industry-wide credibility, will=
=20
provide much needed support to our wholesale electric market reform efforts=
=20
across North America.
Tom Hoatson will now report to Steve Montovano in his new role in supportin=
g=20
the company=01,s efforts at PJM.  Tom will also continue to be an=20
organization-wide resource on technical issues regarding generation=20
interconnection and distributed generation.  Kathleen Sullivan has recently=
=20
joined Steve=01,s group from Azurix and will be primarily assisting Howard=
=20
Fromer in New York.
Sue Nord will head up the group that supports EBS.  Scott Bolton and Donald=
=20
Lassere, while reporting to Sue, will continue to provide leadership on=20
telecommunications issues.  Scott and Donald have done outstanding work and=
=20
will continue to be integral to our efforts in this area.
Finally, the Resource Commitment Review (RCR) process, beginning 1/1/01, wi=
ll=20
be extended to all of Government Affairs in North America, including Federa=
l=20
Government Affairs and Mexico.  The RCR Committee, beginning immediately,=
=20
will be expanded and will consist of Harry Kingerski, Sue Nord,  Linda=20
Roberston, Jim Steffes, Lisa Yoho & myself.
