>Hello Mr. Lay,
>
>I saw something on the news last nite that indicated that you may be
>particpating in the building of the new Basketball stadium, or something of
>that nature, and I got to thinking.  It's really great how Enron helps out
>in all of the funding of these great projects, but the disturbing thing
>about it all, is that my Mother, who is an employee at your company, is not
>allowed to be paid overtime for her very busy department.  She's even
>worked overtime for no pay, and is now threatened to be written up if she
>doesn't leave between 5:00 and 5:30.  I think it's a very dedicated
>employee that will work for no pay, just make sure that the other
>employee's at your company receive their correct compensations.
>My Mom has no idea I'm sending this, and would probably strongly discourage
>it, but it's just something I felt I should do....
>On the other hand, she loves what she does....I even tried to get
>employment at your company because she raved about what a great place to
>work it is.  I think it's something that deserves looking into....
>
>Sincerely,
>
