Dear Mr. Lay,

You might recall very kindly hosting a dinner at The Travellers Club in
London for the first energy retreat that we did with Reinhold Heus and Ralph
Hodge. We were very sorry to have missed you this year though we very much
understand that campaigning for the elections was an absolute priority.

I was very pleased to hear that you had tentatively agreed to be able to
make the 25th May free for next years retreat. This years theme, after a
great del of research is set to focus on e commerce and the new economy and
will look at the inter relationship between energy, communication and
investment. I therefore thought that it would be particularly appropriate
given the outstanding work that you are doing in this area. I am sure that
you will feel that the participants are of great interest and I hope that it
will be a real learning experience for both the state companies and the
international energy companies.

As before the group will be limited to 60 top-level executives from
multinationals, independents and state companies and we would aim that some
of the main issues to be covered include:
* Corporate renewal - develop and maintain a competitive edge
* Diversification in the energy industry: into telecommunications,
power, water, e-commerce, trading, auto  - energy in the new economy
* E - Commerce
* Breakthrough in new technologies

I do hope that you are able to confirm your keynote attendance and look
forward to hearing from you.

I also thought that you might be interested in the attached outlining the
governments with which we work.
I very much look forward to hearing from you. .

In the meantime I remain,

Yours sincerely,
