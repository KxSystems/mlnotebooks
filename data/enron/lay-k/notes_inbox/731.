Attached are several documents which capture our positions in reaction to 
power and gas pricing, particularly in California.  Included are a detailed 
set of solutions to California's power market woes, which we have provided in 
California and at FERC; a representative speech, and a talking point summary 
designed for more general audiences and the media.  The gas paper was 
prepared in September and needs updating, but I have included it as well.  I 
will get a more integrated message put together and circulated.
