                             IMPORTANT NOTICE

TO:       Members of the Board of Directors
FROM:     Ted McNamara
SUBJECT:  Change of December 5, 2000 Americas Society Board Meeting Date.

Our chairman, Bill Rhodes, will be traveling in China on December 5, the
scheduled date of our annual board meeting.  He would like to explore the
possibility of moving the meeting to Monday, December 11, from 9:00 a.m. -
10:30 a.m.  Should you be unable to attend on December 11, there is the
possibility that we could schedule the meeting for Friday, December 8, from
9:00 a.m. - 10:30 a.m.  Please let us know by return email as soon as
possible, if you could make a Monday meeting.  If not, would December 8
work for you?

Thank you for a quick reply.  I will get back to you this week, if you can
all respond quickly.
