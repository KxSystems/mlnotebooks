1. We our best night last night : 63% For / 29% Against for a 4-day roll of
59% For / 34% Against on the ballot.
2. We also had our best night on the intensity: 41% Strongly For / 22%
Strongly Against for a 4-day roll of 38% Strongly For / 27% Strongly
Against on the ballot.
3. Impressions of what was seen, read or head were 52% more likely / 22%
less likely to support the building of a new arena on Thursday.   This
brings the 4-day roll to 45% more likely / 27% less likely.
4. We are in control of the message environment, and this is why we are
doing so well on the ballot.


We are going to win this thing ladies and gents!
