Dear Ken,
Following our past conversations on Iran,it appears  that in 2001 there will 
be? some easing of the sanctions.Along these  lines,and after take-over of 
Lasmo by Amerada-Hess,NIOC is in the final  negotiations with Lasmo
about a buy-back contract.Amerada apparently is  taking a keen interest to 
expand this relationship.In the case that you are  giving some thoughts to 
the post-sanctions project possibilities ,I would be  very happy to have some 
discussions in my next visit?to the States.With  best regards.
Bijan
