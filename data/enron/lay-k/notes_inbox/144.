Rosalee,
?
The Chronicle wants to set up editorial board  meeting with Ken and Jordan 
and Ric Campo re arena endorsement. You can call  James Gibbons for the 
appointment at 713-220-7171. I'll be there at whatever  time you set and send 
a briefing over before hand.Ric needs to be there to  answer the hard 
questions.
