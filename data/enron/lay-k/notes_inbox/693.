Mr. Lay,

Thank you in advance for taking time to meet with me.

I wanted to let you know in advance the topics I would like to discuss.

Now that I have been at EBS for a little over a year, I want to update you on 
my
progress and experiences within EBS.

The other topic I would like to discuss with you is my pursuit of an MBA.  
More
specifically I wanted to gather some of your insight as to pros and cons of 
this
pursuit and how having an MBA with a technical background positions me within
Enron.

I would also like to talk to you about the outside business interest of mine
that I mentioned the night of the RISE School fundraiser.  This interest
fulfills my entrepreneurial desires and for that matter, I have been involved
with this company for the last five years and am one of three principles.


Best regards,

Chad Modad
