Thanks Rosalie.? That's great. I guess this means that Ken and Governor 
Knowles had a good talk!? I think Ken will enjoy it, and it's a great 
platform.? I heard a news report on National Public Radio that mentioned the 
summit already.? Appreciate your help.? Best, Dan

did talk to Governor Knowles. 

Thanks.

Dear Ken, 

It was good to talk with you last week, and I hope you got some vacation in 
Aspen.? I'm working at it! 

Rosalie said you'd be getting in this afternoon, and I? wanted to reach you 
by phone or e-mail before Governor Tony Knowles from Alaska calls you. 
Governor Knowles (classmate of George W.), along with Governor Taft of 
Ohio, has enlisted us in a conference that seven governors are sponsoring 
on natural gas in order to elucidate the market and issues -- and needs -- 
before it explodes as a political issue -- and perhaps helps head it off 
(in contrast to what happened with gasoline).? Governor Knowles is the 
current chairman of the Interstate Oil Compact Commission, and it will be 
under the auspices of the IOCC.? They promise at least seven governors and 
a lot of other distinguished people.? It seems to us that this is a very 
timely event. 

They would like to invite you to be the luncheon speaker.? (I will be 
kicking off the conference).?? It looks to be a very good and high 
visibility platform.? And they would be very keen and excited -- and 
honored -- to have you in that featured role in it works for your schedule. 

It takes place in Columbus, Ohio, on September 20. 

Tony is a very good guy, and of course natural gas as well as oil looms 
very large for him.? You'll enjoy talking with him.? He can certainly fill 
you in further on what they would like to accomplish. 

If it works out for you to do this in terms of your schedule and interest, 
that would be great. 

On behalf of the governors, thank you for the consideration. 

Best, 

Dan
