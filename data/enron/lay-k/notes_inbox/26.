Re: CNBC Advance Notice: Decimal-based Pricing


I want to advise you that as of this Monday, Aug. 28, CNBC will begin
displaying all quotes and price changes in decimals (dollars and cents)
instead of fractions.

As you know, the securities industry as a whole is headed towards decimal -
based pricing.  Both the NYSE and the NASDAQ plan to gradually change over
to decimals to comply with the SEC's mandate of total decimal conversion by
April 9, 2001.  By making the full move to decimals all at once, we are
preparing CNBC viewers for this eventual industry-wide changeover.

I welcome any comments from you or others in your organization about these
changes or other aspects of CNBC coverage.   Please let me know if you would
like to be removed from our ongoing notification list or add others in your
organization.

When you click on the link below you will be able to see four summary slides
that illustrate our new decimal-based formats, as they will appear on
Monday, and access a form to provide feedback..
