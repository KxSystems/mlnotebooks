With regard to working out a convenient date to meet with  you, Rosalee has 
suggested that your week of September 4 is pretty well  booked-up. Would 
either September 11 or 13 work? After that I have to join Norm  Blake at the 
Olympics in Sydney. While all of this can de done by phone, as  deputy to the 
chairmen, I'm making every effort to meet (albeit briefly) with  each 
Committee member. If you are willing to host a meeting in Houston, I want  to 
make every effort to have Paul Newman in  attendance.
