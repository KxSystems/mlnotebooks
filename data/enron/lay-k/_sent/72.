Hi Donna -

Ken said that the letter is fine.  Do you want to send us a list of the past 
Fathers and let us send the letters?

Let me know.

Rosie

Subject: Solicitation to Past Fathers of the Year


Ken,
  Thank you so very much for thinking of this idea.  It is so timely and
certainly fits with Kirbyjon's challenge. I have spoken with Hardie (who
also edited this letter for me) and we both agree that this would have much
greater impact if it came directly from you, as a past Father of the Year.
As you can see we attributed the information about our shortfall directly
to me, so I am involved in the letter but not doing the solicitation.  If
you are not comfortable with this, just let me know and I will redo the
letter.  I think if you agree to send this out over your signature it would
be enormously helpful.  Please let me know what you'd like me to do.

  Thank you again for your thoughtfulness and continuous support.

    Donna
