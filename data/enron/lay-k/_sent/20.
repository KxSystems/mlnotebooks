Mr. Platt -

Ken Lay said that he will approve the $10,000 underwriter costs to be one of 
the five sponsors for the media briefing on March 14.  Mr. Lay has asked me 
to see if Joe Sutton, the Vice Chairman of Enron, might be able to attend.  I 
will pass the information on to him.

Please ask Mr. Radtke to send an invoice to Enron, unless there is some 
better way to handle getting the money to you.

Rosalee Fleming

>    President Clinton will visit South Asia from March

>    Asia Society will provide a briefing to the media

> Ambassador Frank G. Wisner, Vice Chairman, External Affairs, American

> Dr. Marshall Bouton, Executive Vice President, Asia Society.

>    Jagdish Bhagwati will provide an economic overview

>    Ambassador Wisner will provide an overview of
> Indo-US relations and will discuss what President Clinton could do to
> strengthen and enhance those ties.  He will provide his perspective on
> India and the United States, how they perceive and misperceive each other,
> and how some of the misperceptions might be addressed.
