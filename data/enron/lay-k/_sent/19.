Hi Rebecca -

In fact, the Consul General of Ghana, Jack Webb, has called Ken asking him to 
meet with the Ambassador to Ghana March 10 or 11 when he will be in Houston.  
I had put a message on Ken's messages last evening asking if you could handle 
this if you are available, so hopefully he will say yes - especially after he 
sees your message.

Rosie

Ken.

I wanted to get back with regarding your question of Ghana.  You might 
remember that Ralph Hodge had indicated to you that you may well be hearing 
from the Ghanaian Ambassador.  Ralph believes that he will try to facilitate 
a meeting between you and Chevron.

We have been working Ghana pretty hard, including the West African Gas 
Pipeline, the Effasu Power Project, a marketing company and a host of other 
possibilities.  We have told the Ghanaians that with what is going on right 
now in Nigeria, the loss of projects in Cote d'Ivoire due to the coup d'etat, 
and the lack of speed in moving forward in Ghana , that we are slowing down a 
bit to determine if we can resolve current projects before taking on 
additional ones.  

Clearly this is a bit of a "cop out".  I am reluctant to tell Ghana that we 
are slowing down generally in Africa because I don't want to hurt the barge 
deal or jepordize the possible resolution of the large snowball in Mozambique 
and there is truth to the Cote d'Ivoire and Nigeria issues.  And, of course, 
I don't want to alienate Ghana generally.  I have a good relationship with 
the Ambassador from Ghana, in fact, I just got a postcard from him two days 
ago, and when he returns to the US he has indicated that he will call me.  I 
will deliver this message, hopefully diverting the call to you.  If he does 
get to you first, he won't be upset for you to send him on to me, I don't 
believe.

If there is any clarification, please give me a holler.  I hope the office 
opening has gone well.  I've extracted many a promise from participants to 
drink a pint for me.

Regards
Rebecca
