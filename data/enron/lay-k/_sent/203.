Subject: Dornbusch on Income Inequality and Pricing AIDS Medications to a  
Human Scale


Dear Dr. Lay:

New this week on www.TheGlobalist.com:

RUDI DORNBUSCH ON INCOME INEQUALITY
Poverty is bad -- but income inequality is not. MIT Professor Rudi
Dornbusch makes the argument that the development community
should not confuse inequality with poverty -- even though at the
bottom they might feel the same.

Coming Monday: A New Globalist Paper
PRICING AIDS MEDICATIONS TO A HUMAN SCALE
In a scramble for good publicity, pharmaceutical companies have
started a downward bidding war in pricing AIDS medications for
African markets. To add a much-needed measure of fairness to
the process, we propose a better alternative -- adjusting the price
of treatment to per-capita GDP.

Best regards from Washington,

Stephan Richter

JAPAN -- DON'T TRUST ANYONE OVER 55!
During the course of its decade-long economic malaise, Japan
has tried just about every trick in the book to get its economy
growing again. We may have found the answer -- but be warned,
those over the age of 55 may not like it!

CHINA'S CARIBBEAN ISLAND HIDEAWAY
Why does China have an embassy on the tiny Caribbean island
of St. Lucia -- an island 8,000 miles away from Beijing and with which
it has few economic or political ties?

Coming Friday: A New Globalist Bookshelf Feature
ROBERT KAPLAN ON THE TURKEY-ISRAEL AXIS
Turkey is in the midst of an economic crisis -- and Israel's relations
with the Palestinians have steadily deteriorated. So what do these
countries have to gain by forming a strategic alliance?
