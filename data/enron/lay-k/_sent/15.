Subject: Executive Forum's

During our previous executive forums, interest was expressed in holding a 
forum in London for executives who have participated in the Executive Program 
and are based in the UK.  Mary Clark indicates that you will be in London the 
end of this month for an employee meeting.  Following are the names of the 
Enron Europe executives who have participated in the Executive Program to 
date:

Kevin Beasley
Eric Gadd
Eric Gonzales
Matthew Scrimshaw
Brian Stanley
Steve Young
Gregory Cardenas

They will be receiving invitations to the Executive Forums scheduled here in 
Houston over the next few months.  But, I would be happy to invite them to a 
special Executive Forum, specifically for them, in London while you are 
there, your schedules permitting.  Please let me know if you would like me to 
try to arrange this.

             Dick Amabile
