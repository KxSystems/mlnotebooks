Well, I know this is terribly short notice, but Ken does have a meeting with 
Tom DeLay on Monday morning at 9:30 a.m.  (I know that's half a day gone for 
Joe if he's in town), but he is coming in to discuss RMIC (Republican 
Majority Issues Committee).  Are there specific things that Ken needs to be 
briefed on?  I know that Steve did recommend that Ken have this meeting.

Thanks very much.

Rosie
