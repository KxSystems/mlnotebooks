Hi Liz -

"Elizabeth -

The Republican Convention is July 31 - August 3.  Although there are no 
guarantees I expect I can get you tickets and reservations.

Love,

Dad"

Liz, I have sent an e-mail to our Washington office to ask for assistance in 
obtaining hotel reservations and credentials.  We don't yet have reservations 
for Ken as everything is locked up by the Republicans, but I have been 
assured they will be forthcoming.  We asked for the same hotel as your Dad 
will have, so hopefully that will work.

Dad,

Just wanted to e-mail and wish you all the best on the
Openning day, you'll do GREAT! I wish I were there,
I've been getting updates from Kay and Kathy,
particularly about the free doghnuts and Duck Soup!

On another note, when is the Republican Convention? I
would really like to attend if possible.

Best of luck!!!!!
I love you,
Liz

p.s. let me know what the feed back is in regards to
campaign help!
