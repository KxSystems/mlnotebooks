Beau, Ken would like to do this if we can arrange it.  He has a video to 
receive the United Way Kneebone Award from Gerald Smith at 2:30 on Monday, 
May 7.  I'm thinking that maybe we could do this video at 2:00 p.m.  That is 
a lot to do two videos back to back, I guess, but there is very limited time 
available and I think the United Way one will be pretty easy.  Will 30 
minutes be sufficient?

Rosie

Ken -
?
Child Advocates'? 9th annual "Pull for Kids  Sporting Classic" is honoring?
Harry  Reasoner.? Lannie Earthman, at Child Avdocates, told me that they  are 
putting together a short video (a tribute to Harry) for?the night of  the 
event.? Harry doesn't know about the video so it will be a  surprise to him 
that evening.? I've been told by Lannie that, at  Macey's request, those 
being videoed are Dr. Ralph Faigan (Baylor College of  Medicine), Steve 
Miller (CEO, Shell), Malcolm Gillis (President, Rice Univ.),  and hopefully 
you.? Baylor College of Medicine is filming and producing  it.? If you would 
agree to do it, they can film you at your office at your  convenience.? It 
probably wouldn't take very long, unless of  course?you had a whole lot to 
say about Harry.? They want to have it  finished in the next couple of weeks, 
because the event is only a month away  (May 19th).
?
FYI, the Family Foundation?has always  supported the event and this year 
contributed $25,000 (the highest sponsor  level).? I don't think that you and 
Mom are planning on attending the event  or anyone else in the family.
?
Let me know if you would be interested in this so  that I can help facilitate 
it.
?
