> Mountain View, Calif. -- Jan. 24, 2000 -- Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ: INTU
> <http://www.quicken.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=INTU>) announced today
> that its board of directors has selected Stephen M. Bennett as president
> and chief executive officer. Bennett assumes his responsibilities
> immediately, succeeding Bill Campbell, who had been acting chief executive
> since September. Campbell is retiring from day-to-day responsibilities but
> will remain chairman of the board of directors. Bennett was also named to
> the board.
> Bennett, 45, was most recently an executive vice president and member of
> the Office of the CEO at GE Capital, the financial services subsidiary of
> General Electric Corp. GE Capital is the world leader in numerous
> financial industries, including private label credit cards, commercial
> equipment leasing and vendor finance. With $330 billion in assets, GE
> Capital provides 42% of General Electric's overall profits and is among
> the world's largest non-banking financial institutions.
> "Steve is an outstanding leader from a company renowned for strong
> leadership," said Campbell. "His experience is tailor-made to fit Intuit's
> needs now and in the future. We wanted someone with service industry
> knowledge, who had led large, complex organizations and with proven
> ability to produce fast growth. Steve is the ideal choice to take Intuit
> to the multi-billion dollar level."
> "Intuit is the leader in e-finance. Quicken.com is already the leader in
> online tax preparation and online mortgage origination," said Bennett, who
> will relocate from Connecticut to the Bay Area. "I'm excited to have the
> opportunity to continue developing services for the Internet and take
> Intuit's industry leadership to new heights."
> During his GE career, Bennett held significant leadership positions in six
> different businesses within the company, spanning both manufacturing and
> financial services. In his most recent position, he oversaw a portfolio of
> five different companies whose more than 20,000 employees last year
> generated $15 billion in annual volume. Prior to that, as president and
> CEO of GE Capital e-Business, he pioneered the company's efforts to
> leverage the Internet across GE Capital's worldwide portfolio of
> businesses.
> Previously he delivered significant growth as the president and CEO of GE
> Capital's more than 4,000-employee Vendor Financial Services business.
> Under his leadership, assets grew to more than $13 billion from $5 billion
> and net income increased to $200 million from $80 million in four years.
> Intuit board member John Doerr said he was impressed by Bennett's broad
> base of experience. "Steve knows business-to-business as well as
> business-to-consumer. He knows service businesses. And he gets the Net.
> Intuit's product leadership and Steve's ability to grow businesses are an
> ideal match for our future."
> Bennett added, "Intuit's management team is strong, stable and experienced
> and works well together," he said. "This is one of the few management
> teams to successfully and rapidly transform a company to the Net. I'm glad
> to have the opportunity to lead Intuit's continued growth and expansion."
> Scott Cook, Intuit founder and chairman of its executive committee, said,
> "Steve shares Intuit's values. He's a straightforward, no-nonsense,
> results-driven executive who cares deeply about people. His
> values-oriented leadership style energizes organizations to great
> achievement, and I look forward to working with him."
