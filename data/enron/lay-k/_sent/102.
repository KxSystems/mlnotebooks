Hi Jaime -

Thanks for the information about the dinner.  Ken said that he would be 
flying from Aspen to New York (or Washington, if that's the city).  He said 
he would very much like to meet with you for 30 - 45 minutes before the 
dinner for a briefing.  

Thanks.

Rosie

Subject: Dinner with V. Fox

Dear Ken,
 Federico Sada, who is travelling with President elect Vicente Fox in South 
America, called me this morning, 
and asked me to give you the confirmed list of attendees to the dinner in New 
York, Wednesday August 23, 8:00 P.M.
at the Watteau Room of the St. Regis Hotel:

 Sanford I. Weill   Citigroup, Inc.   Chairman and CEO
 Hendrick Verfaille  Monsanto Co.   President and CEO
 William B Harrison, Jr.  Chase Manhattan Corp.  Chairman and CEO
 Raymond V. Gilmartin  Merck and Company, Inc. Chairman and CEO
 Michael Armstrong  AT&T    Chairman and CEO
 Stephen M. Wolf  US Airways   Chairman and CEO
 Kenneth L. Lay   Enron Corp.   Chairman and CEO

Pending confirmation
 Douglas A. Warner III  J.P. Morgan   Chairman

According to Federico, if there is any late cancellation, no one will be 
substituted. Also, there is a small possibility that
the dinner could take place in Washington, rather than N.Y., based on Fox's 
meeting with President Clinton; they are still
working on the final agenda. 
 
 Max and myself are working on the background information that you will need, 
and will keep you posted of any 
changes; best regards,  jaime____
