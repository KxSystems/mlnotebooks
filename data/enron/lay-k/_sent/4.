Dear Mr. Misaki:

Dr. Lay would prefer that the pre-meeting continue to be scheduled at 8:30 
a.m. on January 29, as he has conflicts the afternoon of January 28, so it 
would be difficult for him to attend.

Please advise.

Rosalee Fleming

World Economic Forum-Mr. Nishimuro's Notes
"What should be the environmental agenda for business in the 21st
century?"

.Introduction
1. Awareness of Environmental Issue
1)   Environmental issue, like Global warming, Excessive use of
natural resources, Recycling, Pollution, is of major significance.
The impact on the business is becoming to increase.
2)   The Kyoto Conference(COP3) defined an international framework
for dealing with the issue of global warming.
(The GHG reduction targets contained in the Kyoto Protocol are 6%
for Japan, 7% for the U.S.A., 8% for the EU)
Specific content for the Flexibility Mechanism/Kyoto Mechanism
(for International Emissions Trading (IET), Joint Implement (JI),
and Clean Development Mechanism(CDM)) will be decided on at COP6,
which is scheduled for November 2000.
     GHG is a serious matter requiring a globally studying.

2. GHG Reduction
1)   The relationship between GHG levels and climatic change
remains uncertain at present and further research is required.
Policies will have to be devised that take account of developments
in scientific knowledge and opinion and that also maintains
flexibility.
2)   Policy on GHG reduction must reflect the circumstances of
each country and be based on a combination of regulatory measures,
economic measures and voluntary measures.
     Excessive regulating may cause the unfairness in business
competition.

3. Energy Conservation
1)   The U.S.A. is the largest consumer of energy. In such a
large, mobile country, much
consumption is accounted for by the transportation sector.
2)   The EU has pushed many advances in environmental protection,
and has seen considerable progress in the use of renewable energy.

3)   Japan has very limited natural resources, and energy
conservation has been promoted since the oil shocks of the 1970s.
As a result, Japan is a leader in making effective use of energy,
and has the lowest level of GHG emissions against GDP.
Japan's policy is to combine regulation with voluntary measures.
Industry has supported this by promoting voluntary environmental
plans and other measures.
Japanese industries including Toshiba are to improve the energy
consumption efficiency of their products and use of energy at
their factories.

4. Programme of Industry
1)   Energy conservation is to make up the cost reduction of
products and recycling will bring about the effect on manufacturing
cost saving in the long run.
