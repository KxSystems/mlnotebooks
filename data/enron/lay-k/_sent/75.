Hi -

Our street address is 1400 Smith St., Houston, Texas 77002.  For your 
information, Dorothy is no longer in our office.  Tori Wells is a new contact 
person, in addition to me.

Thanks.

Rosalee

Dear Rosalie/Dorothy:

Tomorrow, we are sending to all participants via Airbourne, reading
materials for the Business Leaders Dialogue in Aspen, Colorado (July 27-30).
We have noticed that our mailing address for Mr. Lay is a p.o. box.
Unfortunately, our express courier will not ship to a p.o. box.  Is there a
street address that you can provide for Mr. Lay so that we can express mail
him his Dialogue materials?

Your assistance in this would be greatly appreciated.


Kind Regards,

Godwin Carmona
Program Coordinator
Aspen ISIB
