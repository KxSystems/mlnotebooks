Dear Colette:

 In response to your e-mail concerning the upcoming New Delhi World Forum, I 
would expect that this forum should evaluate the impact of what is happening 
on our project at Dabohl with reference to enticing other foreign 
investment.  As you probably know, the State of Maharastra has been slow 
paying and no paying for the electricity from our plant at Dabohl for 
sometime and more recently both the State of Maharastra  and the Government 
of India have refused to honor their government guarantees on this project.  
We have filed a political force majeure on the project and indeed will be 
moving into arbitration on that and a number of other issues in London in the 
not too distant future.  Again, I believe this will send a very negative 
signal to the market place as to the advisability of international companies 
investing in India.  I would think you might want to build one panel around 
this subject.  

 If there's any way we can be of help, let me know.

Best regards,

Ken Lay

Subject: India Economic Summit 2001, New Delhi 2-4 December


To the attention of:
Dr Kenneth L. Lay
Chairman
Enron


Dear Dr Lay,

When the Minister of Finance of India Yashwant Sinha recently presented the
2001-2002 national budget, it was widely acknowledged as a very ambitious
"dream budget" which puts India on a high growth trajectory. Most key
sectors should benefit from these reforms, which will thus give a new boost
to the country's economic and social progress. As such, the budget was
welcomed with great enthusiasm by the Indian and international business
community.

On the occasion of our India Economic Summit 2001 to be held in partnership
with the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) from 2 to 4 December in New
Delhi, it will be the perfect time to assess the progress of the bold and
extensive measures proposed in the recent budget, how they have been
implemented and how they have impacted the business environment, domestic
industry activity and foreign investment.

As we will soon be preparing the preliminary programme of the Summit, I
would like to take the opportunity to benefit from your expertise and
understanding of the country. I would greatly appreciate receiving from you
any particular topics or issues that you wish to see given priority on the
agenda. Any suggestions of relevant speakers or experts that you may have
would also be welcomed.

I look forward to receiving your response at the above e-mail address and
kindly ask you to copy my colleague Mitra Khoubrou (e-mail:
mitra.khoubrou@weforum.org).

For more information on the 2001-2002 Union Budget, please visit the
website of the Ministry of Finance of India at http://finmin.nic.in/fub.htm

I look forward to hearing from you and hope that you will be with us in
India again next December.

Best regards,

Colette Mathur,
Director,
Center for Regional Strategies
World Economic Forum
