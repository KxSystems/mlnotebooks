Subject: Tax Free New Issues


 Over the next few weeks, Salomon Smith Barney will be underwriting several
municipal bond issues that will be free of federal, state and local tax.  If
you'd like additional information about these issues, please feel free to
contact me.  Otherwise, take care.

All the best
