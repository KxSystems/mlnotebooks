To Mr. Kenneth Lay,

I write to request that you donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock to the Enron Employee Transition Fund.

Enron's employees are now financially devastated, while you made 100 million in profit.  (No, we don't beleive the statements your wife made on national television about you not having any money).

Sincerely,

Chris Coen
