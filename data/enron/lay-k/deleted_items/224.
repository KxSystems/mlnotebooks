To Mr. Ken Lay,

I think it is the only decent and right thing to do to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.

I invested in your company because I believed in Enron and its financial statements. I am NOT seeking to recover my lost investment, but I do believe that your employees deserve much after their years of hard work making Enron and you rich.
I know you will never read this email and couldn't be bothered with it, but unless you are willing to have your name go down in American history as one of its worse business criminals, you have a chance now to right an egregious wrong.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it. Donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded and nefarious dealings.

Otherwise you will have lost all respect from many decent, hard-working and trusting Americans of whom you took advantage.

May God have mercy on your soul,


Sincerely,


Christian W. Chun
