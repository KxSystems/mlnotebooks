 Mr. Ken Lay,

I'm writing to urge you to do the right thing and give the millions of dollars you earned from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees who lost their retirement savings.  You must treat the faithful employees of your company at least as well as you've treated yourself.

Many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when your company declared bankruptcy. The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings. Perhaps, through this act of kindness you will obtain some level of forgiveness from the employees and the public.

Sincerely,
Stephen Onisko

Stephen Onisko
