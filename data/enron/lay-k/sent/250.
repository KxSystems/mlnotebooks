Dear Nicolas:

I am pleased that you found the Cancun meeting to be a good experience.  My 
wife and I also thought if was a very enjoyable couple of days.

With reference to contacting the appropriate people representing Enron in 
Mexico, you should contact either Jaime Alatorre or Max Yzaguirre.  Either 
one of these individuals could entertain a discussion of how we might be able 
to work together.

Best regards,

Ken

Dear Kenneth:

It was nice seeing you at Cancun. For me and may wife, it was a very
interesting experience to attend this forum.

I would like to know more about your activities in our country. If it is
possible, I would like to contact your representative in Mexico, in order to
explore possibilities of working together in some projects.

I hope you had a good return trip to home
