I am disappointed that Joe Grundfest will not be able to join us at our next 
Advisory Council meeting.  However Tom Campbell sounds like an excellent 
alternative.  Would you please contact him and see if he might be willing to 
join us for the next meeting and talk about the subjects you suggested.  
Incidentally, we're happy to pay an honorarium to any of our guest speakers. 

I think I should pass at this time on inviting Spence Abraham to join us for 
dinner.  First, I believe it would be virtually impossible for him to do that 
at this point in time.  But second, many people are already blaming me for 
being the real energy policy maker in the new Administration and I would just 
as soon not feed that speculation.  

Look forward to seeing you.  

Warm regards,

Ken

Joe and I hve had several conversations trying to work out his schedule, but
his classes plus moving his parents from NYC to California at that time make
it impossible for him to come, although he would very, very much like to do
so.
I would suggest that we invite Tom Campbell, the Republican congressman who
just lost his shot at the senate against one of the two women (I forget which
one, left or lefter) and who is again teaching at Stanford Law School. He is
brilliant, and we could give him the topic of "Enron and Market-Regulatory
Failure: What Are The Constraints on Its Behavior? Where Do the Risks Lie in
the Future?" Or some such thing.
I will read When Genius Fails in the next few hours and decide about its
author.
What would you think of having Spence Abraham to dinner, and moving Bill
Kristol to the morning if Spence can come?
