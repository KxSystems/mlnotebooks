Diane, I will definitely show this to Ken, but he has a Dain Rauscher 
presentation near the Galleria at 8:00 a.m. that morning, so I know he can't 
attend.

Subject: Alzheimer's Research Update

On September 19th Dr. Bill Thies, vice president of medical and scientific 
affairs for the national Alzheimer's Association, will be in Houston to  
provide an update on some of the new and successful research underway for 
Alzheimer's disease.  He'll also be meeting with local reseachers to learn 
what they're doing in order to support and potentially fund their work.  
Since all of you have been such great supporters of our efforts to raise 
funds for this very cause, Phil and I are hosting a breakfast so you can hear 
firsthand how your money is being spent.  No pledge cards will be handed out 
at the door--just juice, coffee and maybe a bagel.  Please join us to hear an 
update from Dr. Thies on September  19 from 7:00 to 8:00 a.m. in the Enron 
Building, Room 49C1.  Please RSVP to Adriana Wynn at X55176.
