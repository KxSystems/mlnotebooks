Good morning, Kitty -

Ken Lay would like to have the Armada M306 series - "the first ultra portable 
notebook designed for the enterprise".  Ken said to go ahead and equip it 
with what you think it should have.

Please let me know when he can expect to receive it.  Thanks, Kitty.

Rosalee

  Here is the link to the latest commercial laptops on the market,  I will
follow up with the consumer models.

The M300 series are the lightest and the E500's are the all in one but much
heavier.
