FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE


               NEWPOWER LAUNCHES ONLINE ENERGY SAVING CENTER

 Residential Consumers And Small Businesses Can Learn How to Reduce Energy

     Usage And Costs; Purchase Full Line Of Energy Efficient Products



PURCHASE, NY, October 29, 2001 ? The New Power Company, the first national

residential and small business energy provider, today announced that it has

launched the Energy Saving Center, a group of online tools to help

residential consumers and small commercial businesses reduce energy usage

and costs.  The Energy Saving Center can be found on www.newpower.com



Key elements of the NewPower Energy Saving Center are the Home and Business

Analyzers.  These on-line audit tools, which are free to all

www.newpower.com visitors, provide a top-to-bottom analysis of energy

usage, and offer specific recommendations on behavior modification and

products that can save energy.   The products can then be purchased through

the Energy Efficient Products On-line Store



The Home Analyzer allows residential consumers to learn how much money

people in homes similar to theirs spend on energy.  They can also uncover

specific energy saving opportunities in their own homes.   Using the

Business Analyzer, small businesses can choose to analyze one facility or

multiple sites.   The tool examines each aspect of a business' energy use

(including which appliances or systems use the most energy), and provides

customized analyses, recommendations, and a means to track their progress.



The NewPower Energy Saving Center is just one way that energy restructuring

is leading to technological innovation and efficiency.  Competition among

energy marketers ? like NewPower ? encourages cost savings and new and

better ways to consume electricity and natural gas.
