Dear Mr. Lay:

Please do take care of the common shareholders and atleast provide them some
stake and hope in all this reorganization.

Please don't make the common man, the individual investor the loser. If you
are kind in this regard, you will be remembered as a man with some
principles and kindness who did not let down his company and his share
holders and the public investors.

May god bless you and may you be kind in turn to all of us poor investors
caught in this.

Thanks,
Ravi
