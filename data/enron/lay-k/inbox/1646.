If there is anything you need, or any way I can help, please do not
hesitate to call.  There are few leaders who have succeeded through
business transformations--in particular, trasformations that require
internal cultures of disruptiveness or reinvention.  You are one of the
few.  You have always demonstrated the ability and the willingness to
take bold moves in redefining Enron and redefining the energy business.

I believe Sitrick can be extremely helpful to you and the company.  I
have used them and have seen their ability to redefine events and
organize a PR defense and offense in difficult situations.  I told Mike
Sitrick to expect a call from you and asked him to personally, as the
owner and CEO of the company, to handle Enron.

You have my support.
