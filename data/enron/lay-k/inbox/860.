Endurance, Encouragement, Hope and Bring Home Good
Fruit

I heard these words today in our Homily at church.
They seemed to jump out at me with the current
situation we have all been faced with at Enron.

You have endured through a tremendous storm.  Although
your colleagues have disappeared leaving you to hold
the bag, although you are at the center of intense
criticism and accusations from investors, shareholders
and employees and although the media has been brutal,
you have endured.  Your endurance, I believe, gives us
the endurance, the encouragement and the hope that
Enron will stabilize and be as strong as it ever was
and with a much stronger foundation.  Turmoil serves
only to strengthen and bring a community together.  It
was true on September 11th and it can be true at
Enron.  We have been shaken, but we cannot give up.
With hope anything is possible.

Enron has been my home for 20 years.  I was there when
we became Enron.  The last week was extremely
difficult for all, "the straw that broke the camels
back" for me was when I came in to workout on Friday
morning at 5:30 a.m. and the Body Shop was closed.  A
note on the front door, "the Body Shop would be
shutting down at 7:30 p.m. Thursday evening".  I had
been so strong up to this point.  After I found a
place to shower, I cried for two hours.  A culmination
of events finally broke me.  I had been so optimistic.
 I am blessed "for the moment", I still have a job.  I
believe I would be blessed even if I didn't have a
job.

I have not given up.  As long as we have you and "you
can endure", I know we will all make it through this
storm.

May God Bless You

Nelda Shealy
