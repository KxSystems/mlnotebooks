Dear Kenneth,
Global security and disaster response are now more urgent than ever, requiring the participation of many countries, governments, agencies, companies, and organizations. You are therefore invited to participate in The Global Security & Disaster Response Summit, scheduled for March 24-26, at the Washington Convention Center in downtown Washington, DC.
The Summit is the premier global forum in 2002 on global security and disaster response. Top U.S., multilateral, and allied officials will be speaking. General session highlights include "Protecting the Government & Critical Infrastructure"; "Relief & Reconstruction of Afghanistan"; and "South Asian & Middle Eastern Economic Development". Numerous workshops will be offered, provided by experts on a wide array of topics, including "What State & Local Emergency Management Agencies Need From the Corporate Sector"; "Security Needs & Resources for Businesses & NGO's with Foreign Operations"; and the programs and procurement procedures and opportunities of numerous agencies, including the Homeland Security Office, FAA, Transportation Security Administration, HHS, CDC, USPS, USAID, U.S. Defense Department, United Nations, The World Bank, and many others.
As a supplier to the security, disaster response, relief, and/or reconstruction and development sectors, you need to be at this extraordinary Summit. Respond by Tuesday, January 15, for substantial discount rates.
