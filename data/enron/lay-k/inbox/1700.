Mr. Lay, 
Just a note of 'Thanks'.  I know you are working hard to get us  through all of this "stuff".  So thanks for being here for us.  I get the following 'Daily Motivator' compliments of Cindy Olson and it seemed appropriate for what we are going through...

Thankful for it all
+++++++++++++++++++++++

Have you ever considered that perhaps your difficulties come
to you precisely because you need them, because of what they
can teach you, because of how they will compel you to grow?
Imagine what would happen if you could look at your troubles
not as some sort of cruel and random punishment, but rather
as a potent form of empowerment.

Do you resent the difficulties in your own life? Why? What
purpose does that resentment serve? There is nothing of value
that it will bring you.

Resenting your troubles only makes them more troubling. It
only brings you down even more. On the other hand, finding a
way to appreciate those problems will help them become a
positive force in your life.

Gratitude will move your life positively forward not only when
you're grateful for your blessings but also when you're grateful
for your troubles. Find a way to be genuinely thankful for it
all, and the reality of your life will reflect that positive
and empowering focus.

Ralph Marston
