Dear Family,

Just for everyone's information, there is no special dress code.  Dinner
will remain casual to casual/chic, as usual.  We have scheduled Allen Ross
to be there early in the evening to help us take a few very special group
photographs.  Because of this we are providing VERY SIMPLE NON-SCAREY
Halloween costumes for the wee ones to put on over their casual attire for
photos.

I don't want to make this a difficult or painful process and the costumes
will hopefully make it fun.  The most important photograph I am hoping to
get is with "Pop-Pop and his six great grandchildren."  If that goes well,
Pop-Pop will step out and Mamia and Papi will step in quickly to be
photographed with all of their precious grandchildren.  Then depending on
whether the wee ones can handle it and don't have melt down, we would also
love for the five children and spouses to quickly join in for a larger group
shot.  If it works, it works...and it doesn't, it doesn't.  NO BIG DEAL!
We'll just see how it goes.

If all goes well, once we have finished with our special photo session, any
of you who may want individual photographs taken are on your own to do so as
you wish.

I hope this answers all of the questions Barb's early e-mail might have
sparked.  If not, call me.

Love, Mamia
