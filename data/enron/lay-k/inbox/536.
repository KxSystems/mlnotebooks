Dear Ken,

Since you and I go to the same church  and are on the Trustee Board together
( First United Methodist Church )   as well as serve together on the Greater
Houston Partnership board ,etc, etc..I think I can imagine how busy you are.
And I know how hard it is to contact you too.I am going to ask this very
informally...but  very sincerely... I have a LARGE favor of you...and I did
not want to ask YOU in public last Tuesday at GHP Ex. Committee  nor  at
lunch with Elizabeth Dole.

I am the new Chairman of  the Theatre Under the Stars  (TUTS) Board. I
preface my request with  that announcement  so you will know how important
this is to me as well as to  TUTS and  the city at large.

IT IS WITH ALL THE EXCITEMENT AND ENTHUSIASM AS WELL  AS GREAT HONOR...that
I tell you that  President and Barbara Bush  have  said YES to being the
Honorary Chairs of the May 18th,2002  Theatre Under the Stars (TUTS) Gala
...our opening night in the new Hobby Center for the Performing Arts .I know
you (very graceously) turned down my request to be a Theater Under the Stars
(TUTS)  Board member...but my favor NOW  is asking you and your lovely wife
to serve as Co- Chairs for that event along with George and Barbara. I have
a few other prominant Houstonians that I will be asking to Co-Chair  along
with you.And if you have anyone you think would be appropriate to serve with
you ...please let me know.


We have some grand ideas and need only your name and influence to make this
a successful evening for TUTS!You and your wife may be as involved or not
involved as you like!We would like to top the funds raised by this current
year's event that was Co -Chaired by Chuck  and Kim Watson .They helped TUTS
to raise over $350,000. We want to raise the bar for this event as it is a
World Premier Opening for an Internationally Reknown Organization....Theatre
Under The Stars.The new theatre holds 2600 people.We want every seat filled
for this event!


The Hobby Center -Music Hall Foundation Board will be having their own
opening Gala...I am sure you have already heard about it...It will be in
April or early May before ours as they are the landlord...we are the #1
tenant...they get to have their opening first ,of course!


Will you give this  request real consideration and say YES!


I would appreciate your answer as soon as you possibly can give it. As we
need to begin the next phase of the  planning asap.

Again, Please forgive my informal way of presenting this very important
Invitation!


Sincerly, Cheryl
