PRACTICAL STEPS TO SPECTRUM MARKETS

Why is it that wireline bandwidth is traded as a commodity while federal regulation effectively blocks the formation of similar markets for wireless? Given the key role of wireless technologies in today's telecommunications sector, the Joint Center will convene a group of experts to discuss this pertinent policy question. Panelists will debate reforms such as liberalization of wireless licenses issued by the FCC, streamlining methods to resolve interference disputes, and other practical steps to enable market allocation of radio spectrum.
