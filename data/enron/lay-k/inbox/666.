Mr. Lay,
  My name is Shelley Farias and I work for EES in the 3 Allen Center.  On F=
riday September 14 at 5:00 P.M. as I was leaving work I saw something that =
frightened me outside the 3 Allen Center.  In a car parked in the circle dr=
ive was a young man about 20 years old of Middle Eastern decent taking pict=
ures of the Enron building and the 3 Allen Center.  Security was at the sce=
ne and asked the young man to stop taking the pictures, he got back in his =
car and continued to take the pictures.  My husband wrote down the license =
plate number and make of the car and gave this information to security.  Se=
curity informed us that they would take care of the situation. I spoke to s=
ecurity this morning and they do not have any report of this incident or th=
e police being notified.   Mr. Lay with everything that has happened to thi=
s country I am scared that something may happen to us.  I would like to thi=
nk I can come to work and be safe, but with security not taking instances s=
uch as Friday seriously I have doubts.  Please let me know what I should do=
 contact the police myself or wait on security?
