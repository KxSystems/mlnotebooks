Ken,

AIG's surety exposure is approximately $132 million.  It is all related to a tax exempt prepay done a couple of years ago.  Obviously, we will not be able to collateralize their exposure.

There appears to be only one bond provided by AIG,  APEA - Nebraska on which AIG holds 50%.  Chubb has the other 50%.  The exposure is one of Joe Deffner's and has a declining balance.  It was originally written for $300,000,000 and is now at approximately $264,000,000.  50% of that number is consistent with AIG's  November 21, 2001, demand for collateral of $131,537,271.

Jim,

I need to get a list of our AIG sureties to Ken Lay.  Could you help me out?  I am sure you have it readily available.

Thanks,

Ray
