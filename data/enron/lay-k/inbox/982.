Dear Ken,

RECEPTION  on Thursday, 31st January, 2002

Once again, it's Davos time - as you know, this year World Economic Form is holding its annual  meeting in New York between 31 January - 4 February 02.

As it is a strange and unfamiliar ground for some of us, I thought it appropriate to invite you,  on behalf of my brothers,  Mohamed and Abdullah, and myself, for a small closed cocktail reception Xenel is holding on Thursday, 31st January at Waldorf Towers between 7.00 pm and 9.45 pm to meet with you to exchange views early on the session.   This event will also give us the opportunity to meet, and interact with WEF Council members and its management, Saudi Arabian participants as well as some of our close friends.

I very much hope that you will be able to join us for the reception. I look forward to hearing from and seeing you again.


Wishing you a very happy and prosperous 2002.


Warm personal regards,

Khalid A. Alireza
