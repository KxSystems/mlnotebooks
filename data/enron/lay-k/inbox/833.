Reading all of the media reports on the $58 million of payments .  All of the reports I have read refer to "executives" receiving payments. I think we need to be very clear that NO executives received payments (at least this is how I understand it).  I am refering to executives as 16b officers.  This will not only clarify the situation for the media, but will help with severed employees as well.
