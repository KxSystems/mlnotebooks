Dear  Ken,
 
First, let me thank  you again for your continued support of Scenic Missouri and Scenic Texas through  your family foundation.  We are very grateful that you have embraced our  efforts to save "America the Beautiful."  
 
Second, I wanted to  make sure you were aware of what I think may be a great public relations  opportunity for Enron.  I think you may have already heard from Kathy  Whitmire about it.  While at a Scenic America board meeting at Harlan  Crow's Camp Topridge (you may have been there), I learned about Scenic America's  upcoming program on PBS.  This will consist of a series of six airings of a  30 minute documentary on Scenic America, its mission and the issues with which  it is involved.  Kathy Whitmire was at the meeting as was Carroll Shaddock,  founder and chairman of Scenic Texas.  A substantial advertising discount  is being made available to the corporation that sponsors this documentary.   This might be a perfect match for Enron, especially in light of your  demonstrated commitment to the missions of Scenic America and its  affiliates.  
 
At any rate, I hope  you will give this your consideration.  Thanks so much for your ongoing  help and support.
 
Sincerely,
 
 
Karl  Kruse
Executive  Director
Scenic  Missouri
