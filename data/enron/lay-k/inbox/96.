RELEVANT TO THE NEWS

Vermont senator James Jeffords has changed his party affiliation from Republican to Independent, giving control of the Senate to the Democrats. Before Jeffords announced his decision, AEI scholar Norman J. Ornstein wrote an article reviewing the White House's relations with the senator and predicting that Jeffords might switch parties. After the announcement, other AEI scholars commented on the turn of events:
