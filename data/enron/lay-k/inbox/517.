Dear Ken,

I hardly ever had to write about the issue of the current affairs that I
feel myself obliged to circulate the attached International Herald Tribune
Article (http://www.iht.com/articles/33780.html) to my close friends.  I
found, however, that the statement made on Wednesday by Premier Berlusconi
in Berlin, to be so damaging to the ideals to which I am sure we all aspire,
that I felt it imperative to share my reaction with you.

To my mind it is self-evident that we all naturally work towards achieving
harmony and co-existence with all believers in the one God to whom we pray.
Mr. Berlusconi's remarks can only serve to divide fellow believers and
nations.  Such statements, in all their divisive and corrosive impact, must
not be allowed to remain unchallenged by society at large.

If you feel as I do, regarding the instinct of a supposed world leader, I
would implore you to write to him to express your condemnation.  It would
obviously be helpful if you would ask your friends to do the same.

At this difficult juncture in world affairs, we should accentuate our common
goals rather than the reverse as Prime Minister Berlusconi's remarks have
done.  Those of influence, must, I believe, make sure that their strongly
held opinions against such ill-judged words are perfectly clear.

Warm regards,
Khalid A. Alireza
