Ken

Just wanted to thank you for the call yesterday and
for staying in touch during this tumultuous period.

My remaining time at Enron is limited but I wanted to personally
tell you what an honor it has to work with and
learn from you during my seven plus years with the firm.
You created something very special and most of us who were there
know that the benefits to the economy and to people's
lives will surely outweigh the negatives of recent times.

But the most important think I have learned from you is
"grace under fire".  You always kept your calm; you always
were there to take problems on one at a time, and you never
stopped giving your best.  Thanks for the important lesson!
I am so pleased to have had the chance to be a part of it all.

John
