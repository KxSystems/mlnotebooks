igma Institute   =09
=09 What You Can Expect From This Seminar:  Become a Certified Lean Six Sig=
ma Master!     A world-class company cannot afford to overlook the global m=
etric of Six Sigma to reduce variation and waste. These companies are also =
using lean techniques to increase throughput and reduce cycle times. This c=
ourse shows you how to integrate Lean and Six Sigma tools to achieve busine=
ss performance excellence. You'll attend four intensive weeks of integrated=
 Lean and Six Sigma instruction--one week of seminar per month for four mon=
ths. Between instruction weeks, you'll focus on getting results for your or=
ganization by using the tools in your own work environment. You'll devote a=
t least one-third of your back-at-the-plant: time to an actual business per=

 will provide review and critique. =09About the Seminar Leaders:      Caryl=
