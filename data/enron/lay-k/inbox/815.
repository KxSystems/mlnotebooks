Dear Ken . . .

I'm truly heartbroken at the "perfect storm" which seems to have
engulfed Enron.  I'm sure that last few months have been unbelievably
stressful for you personally. YI wanted you to know that you
can call on me, anytime, anywhere and under any circumstances if I can
be of any help whatsoever--no compensation expected.  It is my hope that
our
friendship willsurvive the current calamity.  I admire your
accomplishments enormously, Ken, and I am
eager to repay some of the generosity you have shown to me and Strategos

in recent years.  If there's anything you'd like to talk about, at any
point, please do get in touch.  I shall be praying for you and all the
Enron team in these extraordinarily trying times.  Please stay in touch.

Gary.
