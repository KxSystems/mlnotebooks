Ken,

Thank you for the email addresses of Enron's Board of Directors.  I will
present my position to them.

The best attribute of a really good "Top Gun" is that they operate most
effectively in an offensive mode, not in a defensive mode.  Develop and
maintain your offensive positions and follow through.  Too bad about
Andy but, under the circumstances, replacing him is the start of a good
offense.

Good luck!

Neal Shaw
