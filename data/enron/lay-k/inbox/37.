Dear Ken

I sent you a letter earlier this week that you should receive soon.  It
invites you to deliver keynote address at the UH Scholarship and Community
Conference this fall.  I just wanted to alert you that this has been a
stimulating event in the past and the type of scholarly exchange I suspect
you would enjoy.

Sincerely,

Ed
