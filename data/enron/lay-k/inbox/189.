U.S. CLIMATE POLICY: WHAT'S NEXT?

In a move that stunned the world, the Bush administration withdrew U.S. support for the Kyoto Protocol that addresses climate change. The protocol, which was never submitted for Senate approval, would have limited greenhouse gas emissions from developed countries. The question is what to put in its place.  As the Bush administration grapples with this complicated problem, we have assembled a team of experts to share their views on sensible climate policies for the U.S. in a post-Kyoto world.
