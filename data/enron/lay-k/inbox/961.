3) New RFF Publications
Discounting the Benefits of Climate Change Mitigation: How Much Do
Uncertain Rates Increase Valuations?

How can we compare the costs of greenhouse gas reduction measures taken
today with the future benefits of these actions?  This new report for the
Pew Center on Global Climate Change challenges conventional wisdom and
concludes that immediate action to address global climate change could
yield significantly greater benefits in the long-run than conventional
economic models suggest.

Reforming Permitting

The system of U.S. pollution control permitting is suffering from major
defects and weaknesses; it is often fragmented and inefficient. Although
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the states have initiated
reforms, the United States is among a dwindling number of industrialized
nations that have not yet adopted an integrated approach to pollution
control.

Terry Davies with Robert Hersh, Aracely Alicea, and Ruth Greenspan Bell |

Discussion Papers:
Implementing Electricity Restructuring: Policies, Potholes, and Prospects

Electricity is one of the last U.S. industries in which competition is
replacing regulation. This paper reviews the technology for producing and
delivering power, the history of electricity policy, and recent state and
international experience. It outlines the major questions facing
policymakers as they decide whether, when, and how to implement
restructuring and concludes with some thoughts on the California
electricity crisis and other political controversies. This paper draws upon
the forthcoming book, Alternating Currents: Electricity Markets and Public
Policy.

Timothy J. Brennan, Karen Palmer, and Salvador Martinez | December 2001

Is There a Rationale for Rebating Environmental Levies?

Political pressure often exists for rebating environmental levies,
particularly when incomplete regulatory coverage allegedly creates an
"unlevel playing field" with other, unregulated firms or industries. This
paper assesses the conditions under which rebating environmental levies is
justified for the regulated sector.

Alain Bernard, Carolyn Fischer, and Marc Vielle  | October 2001

Ancillary Benefits of Reduced Air Pollution in the United States from
Moderate Greenhouse Gas Mitigation Policies in the Electricity Sector

This paper considers how moderate actions to slow atmospheric accumulation
of greenhouse gases from fossil fuel use also could reduce conventional air
pollutants in the United States. The benefits that result would be
"ancillary" to greenhouse gas abatement. Moreover, the benefits would tend
to accrue locally and in the near term, while benefits from reduced climate
change mostly accrue globally and over a time frame of several decades or
longer.

and Cary Bloyd | December 2001
