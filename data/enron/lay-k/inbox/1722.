Dear Ken:

These are very difficult times for all of us, but I know that you and those who work closest with you are under unbelievable pressure at this time.  It's difficult for all of us, but you and your staff need to know that you have a great deal of support within the company.  Since I started with EDC in 1996, I have often felt that this is the best job that I ever had.  In good times and not-so-good times, the work has been interesting, challenging and even fun!  Now that you are "back" many of us are more confident of the future -- even at this time when things appear to be so bleak.

Enron has treated me very well in the past, and although we face an uncertain future, I will continue to support the company and especially you.   Your gestures toward the employees are much appreciated.    I have always admired your kind and  respectful attitude toward all who work for Enron, never more than now.   You have been our best representative and our best supporter, not to mention what you have done for the city of Houston.  No matter what happens, I will always feel privileged to have been a part of this organization.

Most sincerely,

Nancy Muchmore
