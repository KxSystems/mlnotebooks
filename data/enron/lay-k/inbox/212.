I understand that you will be meeting with Harry Clark on Wednesday, and
thought I should share with you my impression of him. I have had mutual
clients with Harry, and although I have a bias against guys in his business,
I found him extraordinarily useful. For one thing, he is intelligent; for
another, perhaps as a consequence of the first, he doesn't over promise; for
still another, I have never seen him give a client bad advice. He is
certainly worth a serious hearing.
Let me repeat here what I have said in a note sent to your home: if there is
anything I can reasonably do to be useful let me know.
See you in San Antonio.
