"In quietness and confidence is your strength."  --  Isaiah 30:15

	A missionary in India was kneeling at his bed praying one night when a
giant python snake uncoiled itself from the rafters and wrapped itself
around his body.  The python, which is not uncommon in India, kills its
victim by squeezing it to death.  The missionary told how a Bible verse
immediately came to mind as the meandering serpent enveloped his body.  "In
quietness and confidence is your strength."  And suddenly he was filled with
the calm assurance that God was in control!  He remained perfectly still,
praying and meditating like he never had before!

	Had he struggled, hesitated or tensed up, the coils of the mighty creature
would have constricted and crushed him!  Instead he waited, prayed, stayed
calm and didn't move a muscle.  Slowly, the snake uncoiled itself and
retreated back to the rafters.

	Most of us admire that kind of quiet COURAGE.  I don't believe there is a
value that is more recognizable and admirable in a human life than courage.
Claim the courage that is yours as a child of God.  God wants you to be
courageous!


I AM MADE FOR CONFIDENT, COURAGEOUS LIVING.  TODAY, I CAN FEEL MY FEARS
SLIPPING AWAY AS GOD FILLS ME WITH COURAGE!

I Love you.

Linda
