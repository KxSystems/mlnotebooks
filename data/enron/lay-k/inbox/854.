What the polls say ...  Week 5 (12/3 to 12/19 )

M U is ranked number 3 in the ESPN coaches poll, number 2 in the better poll (AP).

Our Saturday opponent,  previous match:

Iowa is ranked number 11 with a 6 win and 2 loss record.   One of those losses was a defeat at the hands of M U on the day before Thanksgiving.

Was it a close game?

Let's step back in time ...Iowa is up 77-71. Kareem Rush ties it with TWO three pointers.  Now 41 Seconds left. Clarence Gilbert drives down court, shoots for two, and is fouled.

Gilbert at the free throw line. Iowa calls time out. Ready Gilbert ?..No Iowa calls a second time out. Gilbert misses the first shot. Iowa calls another time out.

        With eight - tenths of a second remaining Gilbert makes the free throw.

        Final Score M U 78 , the other team 77.

More History:

Last week the headline was Stokes Sinks St. Louis with his final shot at the buzzer.
Final Score, MU 69, St. Louis 67

And last nights game excerpt from the Maneater at http://www.themaneater.com/story.cgi?id=12400

'TIGERS TAME JAGUARS

Coach Quin Snyder said he wanted more output from his preseason All-American Kareem Rush. He got it from Rush, but he got even more from his lone senior, Clarence Gilbert.

Rush scored 25 points in 22 minutes, and Gilbert added 29 in 23 en route to a 117-67 victory over the Southern Jaguars. The 117 points were sixth for MU all-time high scores, as the Tigers scored 100 points
or more for the third consecutive home game.'
