Mr. Lay,

A group of former DSG employees have tried to receive information about the status of our DSG 401k's.  We were promised that our accounts would be super-vested and then moved to Enron's 401k plan.  We expected this change to take at the most 6 months.  It has been two years...  We were told on several occasions that our accounts had been super-vested and we were waiting on Enron to move the accounts.  We are now being told that our AUL accounts can not be moved and in fact are frozen.  Marla Barnard was our HR representative at the time of the acquisition.  She has directed my questions to Mike Rath in Benefits, who has never responded.  Can someone please explain why the super-vesting and moving of the funds did not occur, the rules associated with the account freeze and why we are not receiving our statements from AUL?

I did not receive any info from Mikie Rath.  Does this mean that I can not borrow from my AUL 401k?  The majority of my money (11 years) came from Amoco not DSG.  Does that matter?

Debbie, I forwarded this message to Mikie Rath in benefits - did you get a response?  If not, I do have some info. I can provide, but she would need to assist you with any particular details.  Please see below - I just learned recently that it does not appear much of this info. was communicated to DSG employees after the acquisition.

1- The assets contained within the DSG 401(k) plan cannot be transferred to the Enron plan because the plan was never authorized by the IRS.
	
2- Prior DSG employees cannot transfer funds out of the AUL 401(k) into a self directed IRA, because Enron purchased the assets of DSG. Therefore termination applies to Enron employment, not employment by DSG in regards to transfer of said assets to a self directed account.
	
3- The DSG plan with AUL will remain intact and Enron will pay all associated administrative fees until all employees represented by the plan are no longer in employed by Enron

	4- Since the plan is frozen, vesting service should continue to accrue as long as the employee remains with Enron.  Only if the plan is terminated does "super vesting" occur.  The purchase agreement may have assumed that the plan was going to be terminated which could explain that language.

 Marla  ,

I am a former employee of DSG.  We were purchased by Enron, Dec. of  1999 .  We were promised that our 401K's would be moved to Enron's 401k plan.  This has never happened.  I no longer receive AUL (401k company) statements.  AUL claims that it sends the statements to the administrator of the plan at Enron.  I would really like to transfer my money to Enron's 401k or at least receive a statement of my account at AUL.


Thanks!
