We had previously discussed Stan's group presenting a business unit update at the Dec. 11 Board meeting, and he will begin preparing soon.  I recommend we proceed with his business unit review at this meeting, particularly given the important role his pipeline assets play in the debt and equity financings and his other businesses play in the asset sales program.  Please advise if you do not feel this business unit presentation is necessary. 

I am soliciting agenda items from other areas of the company and will keep you informed.  Thank you very much.  Paula
