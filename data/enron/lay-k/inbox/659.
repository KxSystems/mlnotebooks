Dear All,
The business units are operating on a lean G&A budget and cut costs whenever we can and making sure that we are efficient.  Are there any initiative to do likewise for all corp functions?  As an accountant in the business unit, we received corp allocations.  The total for corp was more than $700MM.  This, of course, excludes Enron Net Work, Enron Property, and Global Finance, which if we include those, the G&A to Enron could well be over $1Billion (not counting the business units G&A).  

The number just blew me away.  I think we need to make sure all functions are needed and are run efficiently.  We cannot say it's OK just because we can allocate to the business units because the business units may not receive benefits for these costs.   We sure don't want Enron, as a whole, to be growing so fat and so fast that it will hurt our bottom line.  I'm sorry if I'm out of line, but I really do care about Enron and am very proud to be its employee.  

Thank you for your time.
