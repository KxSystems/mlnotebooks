Mr. Ken Lay,
To explain further , I put $25,000.00 in Enron Capital Limited Life
company 8%PFD cumulative guaranteed monthly income preferred shares.
CUSIP# P37307108 bought 11-04-1993 in name of Sue Diviney Hester through
A.G Edwards acct. # 42-323-160. In reading the prospectus dated Oct. 25,
1993 page S14 under General , second paragraph . The entire principal
amount of the loan will become due and payable upon the date which Enron
is dissolved , wound up or liquidated or the date upon whichEnron Capital
is dissolved or liquidated. There is more that I won`t refer to at this
time . I do hope you can find a way to repay this debt under some of
these provisions , please give it your attention . I know this is small
stuff and you are busy but I need your help Mr. Lay . Maybe I can count
on you to find a way out for me so I can continue to be able to support
myself.

What about our medical benefits, can it possibly continue ? I have had
cancer as well as an uncurable lung diesese . I can not see any way I
will be accepted in other plans .

I am holding 200 shares in Northern Borders Partners LP unit partnership
interest since 9-23-1993 CUSIP 664785102 at First Chicago Trust . Acct
#8124-27264. It looks like it maybe holding its value now but will it be
effected by what ever happens to Enron ?

Enron was a great company, I was so proud of it. You made it that and you
can do it again if given half a chance. I Pray someone will put enough
confidence in it so it can remain a company to build on and become a lot
better than it was with out the selfish greed that has brought this on
us.

Thank you for reading my letter,
Sue D. Hester
