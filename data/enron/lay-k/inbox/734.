Hank McKinnell of Pfizer has called Bill Esrey and advised him that Bill
Gates has indicated a desire to become a member of The Business Council.  As
you will recall, we had asked Bill once before but he declined.  Apparently
he has had a change of heart.

Technically, Gates is not the Chairman of Microsoft.  We could invite him to
join as a Graduate member or, in view of the special "circumstances" we
could elect him as an Active member.  It is, obviously, an issue for the
committee to decide.  Please let me know your thoughts as soon as possible.
We would like to extend our invitation this year in time for him to attend
in February.

Phil
