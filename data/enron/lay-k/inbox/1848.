Hello,


I feel like I am in a bad dream and when I wake up all this merger stuff will be a joke.  Why Dynegy?  The culture is so different.  I had the opportunity to work
for Dynegy and there where many racial and uncomfortable events that happen for many employee's.  We lost our name with this Merger as well as the pride.  I
truly believe another solution will come to surface.  Hopes and Prays can developed us all from this disappointment.


Thanks,
