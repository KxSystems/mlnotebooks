Mr. Lay,

Recent developments with EBS are causing me significant concern. I became employed by Enron (EBS) as part of the acquisition of DataSystems Group, Inc. in 1999. Part of that employment agreement included a retention bonus, payable in three installments in March of 2000, 2001, and 2002. We were told that bonus was payable if we did not voluntarily terminate (quit) prior to those dates.

With the highly uncertain future of EBS, I am faced with two likely scenarios:

Scenario 1 - EBS terminates as part of a severance prior to February of 2002.
I receive no bonus for 2001 after working countless hours of overtime to "save EBS".
I receive no retention payment because I was severed prior to March 31.

Scenario 2 - Enron divests EBS to a third party.
Third party terminates employment with little or no severance.
I receive no bonus for 2001 after working countless hours of overtime to "save EBS".
I receive no retention payment because I was severed prior to March 31.


As my wife and I both work for EBS, this is an even greater concern to me. 

At the recent all-employee meeting, you asked everyone to redouble their work, work harder and more than before to help pull Enron out of this current crisis. I find it difficult (as do those working for me) to commit to this effort while we're facing what appears to be almost certain personal disaster. We have been working tirelessly on the Microsoft deal since the beginning of the year. It now is beginning to look like we'll see no acknowledgement from Enron for the work.

I would like to know what you and Enron can do to assuage the concerns my reports and I have over these issues.

Thank you,

Tim
