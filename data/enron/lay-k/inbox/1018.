Mr. Lay:
 
Why couldn't you have worked with us?  This is  the worst time of year and being in a recession has negatively impacted my  prospects for work.
 
I've got a ton of experience and no one wants to  talk to me.
 
I'm going to lose my home!!!!  You guys with  your millions and I'm going to be devastated.  What are you thinking  about?  I can't hardly sleep at night worrying about how I'm going to  provide for my family.
 
Thanks,
 
John W. Harwood
