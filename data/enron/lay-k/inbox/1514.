Ken,
=20
I am emailing in the hopes of having an opportunity  to talk if you are int=
erested in the following possibility -- AOL Time Warner  has given us a gre=
at opportunity to spotlight the organizations that are  providing systemic =
responses to 9-11 (not just relief efforts) so that these  organizations ca=
nnot be left cold by the shadow of the American Red Cross  but that they in=
stead can receive support at this critical time.  =20
=20
Below is what I sent to AOL TW in response to  their invitation for the wor=
k described below and their great offer to feature  us on their site and ww=
w.libertyunites.org .  I wanted to  talk with you because AOL TW and I want=
 to know if you can join AOL TW and  support this initiative.
=20
If possible, please let me know if we can talk  sometime soon.  Thanks for =
considering this.

In the wake of the events of September  11,  the generosity of individuals,=
 foundations and businesses has never been more  evident.  The response to =
Sept. 11 has begun to shift from a "relief"  effort to efforts that address=
 the systemic changes that are needed for societal  conditions to improve. =
 Now more than ever, social investors will be  looking for organizations th=
at address both the root causes of social problems  and create sustainable =
social change.  At this time, the American Red Cross  continues to be delug=
ed with support; but what about the organizations that live  in the shadow =
of the Red Cross?  The Red Cross and similar  organizations are doing outst=
anding work when they are needed most -- now  other organizations are movin=
g beyond the immediate relief efforts of feeding,  clothing, housing the vi=
ctims and are recognizing that there are new or  exacerbated problems that =
have been stirred up by Sept.  11.
=20
For  example, there are numerous organizations protecting civil liberties, =
providing  counseling, preparing communities for future disasters, and assi=
sting displaced  workers:
organizations, such as the Ella Baker Center for  Human Rights, are steppin=
g up their efforts to combat racial profiling that  has begun and is leadin=
g to the harassment of people who look of Middle  Eastern descent; =20
organizations are supporting this same constituency  when they are the vict=
ims of hate crimes that have been perpetrated as a  backlash to September 1=
1. =20
children are in need of counseling as a result of  their personal fears or =
fears for their parents and  family; =20
organizations, such as Operation USA, are  recruiting and deploying counsel=
ors trained in post-traumatic  stress to areas where needed;=20
efforts are underway to enhance community  preparedness for acts of terrori=
sm in their communities (such as evacuation  procedures); and =20
organizations, such as Career Gear, are assisting  low-income workers who l=
ost their jobs as a result of Sept. 11 and now need  career counseling, app=
ropriate interview clothing and job retention services  so they do not fall=
 into the spiral of welfare.  (Please note that each  of the organizations =
mentioned above are SeaChange  members).

These  are just a few examples among many efforts that have commenced to re=
spond to the  call for change and not just service.  Life will never be the=
 same.   These organizations are working to see that it will in fact be bet=
ter.   But, unfortunately, they are not known by most philanthropists, foun=
dations or  businesses.  In fact, we have heard from organizations that som=
e businesses  are pulling back from commitments to these smaller organizati=
ons to associate  with the larger organizations providing rescue, relief an=
d recovery  services.  These lesser-known organizations, who are doing crit=
ical social  change work, need to feel the philanthropic winds in their sai=
ls too so they can  make progress toward much needed change.
=20
Many funds have been created to earmark money for  the Sept. 11 response, b=
ut the recipients of a significant portion of those  monies have not yet be=
en identified.  Companies have, for example, set  aside several million dol=
lars and have earmarked half or more for the Red Cross,  but still have not=
 decided what to do with the rest of the funds.  For  these Funds, for www.=
helping.org  and  www.libertyunites.org , and for social  investors in our =
network, SeaChange is uniquely positioned to become the source  of informat=
ion of organizations that are moving beyond relief efforts and  are focused=
 on the systemic changes necessary for conditions to improve.   On their be=
half, SeaChange can directly approach the administrators of these  Funds an=
d other social investors to make them aware of these overlooked change  org=
anizations. =20
=20
The mission of SeaChange is to connect  entrepreneurial nonprofits with res=
ources for sustainable social  change.  We will do just that by spotlightin=
g the very organizations that  can have an impact not only today, but tomor=
row as well.   For social investors, we will provide them with detailed  in=
formation about a broad menu of screened organizations working to effect  s=
ocial change not only in response to Sept. 11 but also in response to the  =
changed environment in which we now live.  SeaChange also provides these  p=
otential supporters with an easy way to search for organizations that meet =
 their giving specifications. Additionally, they can be notified of organiz=
ations  that meet their criteria -- doing all of this anonymously if they c=
hoose  to.   And, as discussed above, we will not only do this online, but =
 offline as well by advocating to various Fund adminstrators.   As  a resul=
t, SeaChange will effectively and efficiently connect those who are  seekin=
g support at this critical time with those who are looking to give their  s=
upport.
