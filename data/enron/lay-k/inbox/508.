I am aware that you are a member of Compaq's Board of Directors.
 
We see similarities in Enron's needs and Compaq's current deployment architecture.
 
I am sending you this e-mail to suggest that we arrange for you and your executives to visit Compaq.
 
In the interim, I would ask that you contact Marius Haas, Compaq's VP, WW eBusiness.
