Dr. Lay,

Sir, I am almost positive that all avenues have been pursued to get Enron out of the hole we are in.  However, I wanted to inquire if a reverse stock split (perhaps a 12 to 1 or 15 to 1) was a possible option.  My knoweledge in terms of Enron's debt and who we are indebted to is limited to what I have heard through the media, but as I see it, many creditors are at a great risk to lose billions of dollars.  Would banks such as JP Morgan or Citigroup or others potentially affected such as Janus Funds or Lehman Brothers be willing to invest in equity rather than pump in more debt?  From my understanding, we need an immediate $4 billion, and I think this may be a potential solution to get instant cash, and then we can turn our interests to building customer and investor confidence.

I hope I am not wasting your time with this, but this is not the time for any of us involved with this company to remain silent.  Thank you for your time. 

Sincerely,
Suketu Patel
