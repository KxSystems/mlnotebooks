Ken and Tori:

Thank you for your reply Ken.  The other days that could be made to work
are November 2 or October 12.  Do either of those days work logistically
for you.  I appreciate very much your willingness to help. I look
forward to hearing back. R.

Mr. Martin:

In reply to your request for Dr. Lay to speak, he has asked that I reply
to you with the following message.

"Advise that the date just doesn't work because of our Manager's
Conference but on a different date either I or one of my officers could
probably participate".

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.

Tori L. Wells
