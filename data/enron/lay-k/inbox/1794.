Good Morning,

Please is there anything we can do?, maybe get together our own finances to help Enron.  What if there was a way we (The Enron Family) could gather the funds needed to stay ENRON.  We're pretty much will to do whatever it takes.  Enron is our company and we're here.  Noone asked the employees if they were willing to help out.  We can all attempt to get loans and give the money to Enron.  If you'd ask, you'd be suprised as to the respone you'd get.  We love the company and are willing to do what it takes.  Enron is Enron.

I hope this prosposal gets address in some way.  We're here to help and serve you Mr. Lay.  

God Bless Mr. Lay, The Enron Family, and America!
