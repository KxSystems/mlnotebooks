Oh Mr. Lay, I am woefully sorry. I know you will be talking to the employees soon and I will be praying for you. 
I was just praying and asking God what I could say to you. I don't want to be presumptuous. This is the verse that came to mind. Psalm 34:19 "Many are the afflictions of the righteous: but the LORD delivereth him out of them all."  
You may not feel righteous right now but you are. When you gave Jesus your life, you became righteous. So you will be delivered-it may not look like it now but this is not the end of the story. He has a plan. I know that you can't see HOW this could work together for good for you but it will. Great is His faithfulness! All afflictions-it says. ALL!

I really appreciate your e-mail.  I have relied heavily on my faith, The 
Bible and prayer to get through the last few weeks.  Without God's help, 
I 
would have surely crumbled.  May He continue to bless you.

   Mr. Lay, 
   I am a former employee of Enron and have been through many trials in 
the 
   past few years. God has been faithful and seen me through them all. 
Dear 
   sir, I can tell you that I can count it all joy. I just want to 
   encourage you. These look like very dark times right now. Call upon 
the 
   name of the Lord. Throw yourself on the mercy and grace of the Lord 
and 
   remember all that he has done. He is a BIG, GOOD God that LOVES you! 
His 
   arm hasn't been shortened that He cannot help you. 
   You will be glad to know that the true testimony of you as a man is 
of a 
   good report. You will glorify God in this. I am listening to a song 
   right this minute that I so wish you could hear. It would bring you 
such 
   comfort. It is based on the verse that talks about "all of my help 
   cometh from the Lord". How true that is for you. 
     Lord Jesus, you are a good God that sees all things. Mr. Lay is a 
man 
     of God. That means he is your child. You tell us that you are an 
ever 
     present help in time of trouble. These troubles are over his head 
but 
     under your feet. Lord Jesus, show yourself strong on his behalf. 
     Glorify yourself and Mr. Lay will give you the glory. He knows, 
Lord. 
     Help him in this time when the waters are flowing over his head. 
Hear 
     him from where you are. We are all but dust. Who are we that you 
are 
     mindful of us but you tell us in your Word that You have good 
thoughts 
     and plans for us and they are for good and NOT EVIL that we may 
have 
     an expected end. (Jer 29:11-For I know the thoughts that I think 
     toward you, saith the LORD, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to 
     give you an expected end.) Who can stand except you give us grace? 
     Lord, you are so good. Remind Mr. Lay of who you really are. In the 
     mighty name of Jesus! 
   Mr. Lay, get some scripture to hang onto-write it down on a card and 
   carry it with you. When things come against you (the enemy), you will 
   need to remember who you are in Jesus! The greatest battle on earth 
was 
   fought with the Word of God (Satan against Jesus in the wilderness)! 
   Isaiah 54:17-No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and 
   every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt 
   condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of the LORD, and their 
   righteousness is of me, saith the LORD. 
   Oh Mr. Lay, one more thing. I am telling you that I haven't a clue as 
to 
   what has or has not been done. I just want to show you something from 
   the Word of God how God is. If you will read Isaiah's calling in 
Isaiah 
   6 and read Moses' calling in Exodus 3, you will see that God DOES NOT 
   mention their sin to them. Isaiah was just overcome with the glory of 
   God and confessed all by himself and Moses (remember he had killed an 
   Egyptian) was just trying to convince God that He had to be wrong. 
The 
   ONLY reason I mention it is because sometimes we delay in going to 
God 
   because we think we have done something wrong. God tells us that He 
   hasn't dealt with us according to our sins. KNOW that NO MATTER WHAT, 
   Jesus is ready to fight on your behalf! It is ALWAYS about God's 
SPIRIT 
   and not our strength. 
   When I started this email, you were just a stranger. You are now my 
   beloved brother in Christ. Isn't it amazing how God works. He has 
knit 
   my heart to yours. I will be on my knees for you. Phillipians tells 
us 
   to pray for E-V-E-R-Y-T-H-I-N-G! What does everything mean? 
EVERYTHING! 
   God's gonna do some amazing stuff so get ready!!!! His ways aren't 
our 
   ways and remember too-He is able to do EXCEEDINGLY ABOVE what we can 
ask 
   or think!

   The Joy of the Lord is my strength...
