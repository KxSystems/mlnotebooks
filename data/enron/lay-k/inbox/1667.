Ken,

In the midst of all the criticism of the company and noise from all sides, I
wanted to let you know I think of you often, reflect on the occasions when I
have been at the table as you sorted through difficult situations and have
the utmost confidence in your ability to do so again.

Let me know if there is anything I can do to help-with RFF or otherwise.

Dod
