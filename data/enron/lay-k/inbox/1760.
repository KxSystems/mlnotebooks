Dear Mr. Lay:
Sub: Sale of Power Plant in India

I met you in your office with rev. James Dixon regarding earthquake in India.
I came to Washington to see Honorable Prime Minister of India today.

After reading in Nov. 12th issue of Business Week, I talked with Ambassador of
India regarding sale of power plant built by Enron India. He said that
discussions are going on in Singapore. Hon. Prime Minister will be in
Washington Friday also.

If you would like to pursue selling the power plant in India to Tatas or any
other party soon, please email or have your office call me at Washington
contact phone number 301 897-3488 Friday. I will be back in Houston Sunday
afternoon.

I have also met Dr. Boyce who lives in your complex on 28th floor, 2121 Kirby.
We both are working on Fundraising for fallen Fire Fighter Jack Janhke,
Woodway station number 2.

Sincerely,
Sam Kannappan P.E.
