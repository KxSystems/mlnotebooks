Dear Mr. Lay,

My name is Djoefree Hermanto and I am one of Enron
shareholders.

I just like to mention that I really have full
confident in you.

Even though, the current Enron situation financially
impacts my family, but I fully believe any decision
that you will make is definitely the best for everyone
of us.

I'll support you and your team with prayers.

Thank you.

Sincerely,
D. Hermanto
