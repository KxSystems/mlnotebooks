Sean,

	Could you follow-up on the replacement badge you issued me this morning asap?  Or tell me if there is a 24-hour hold before the badge works.  It does not work.  I've been trying to get through to you all morning with no return call.  I can be reached at 853-0919.  

	Thanks in advance.

		Debbie
