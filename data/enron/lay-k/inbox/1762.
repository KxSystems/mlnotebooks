A request for 2002 contribution was mailed from the NCPA in error this week.
We realize Enron is going through a tough time, and wanted to apoligize for
sending a request for money at this time.

John and I wish you our best, and know your strength will overcome this
challenge.

We appreciate your efforts on our behalf, and look forward to seeing you in
the future.
