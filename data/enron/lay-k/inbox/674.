Mr. Lay,

In light of your announcement I would like to make a $1000.00 personal donation, I will go on line to do this this morning . Also I was wondering if there was something I could personally such as going to NY in person to aid in the physical recovery process or lend my logistical professional expertise to help organize things. If this is possible, will the company support and excuse me for a period of time to lend this kind of support? I just feel like I need to do something significantly more that the money donation though I know that within itself is very important?

Kind Regards,

David Rollins
