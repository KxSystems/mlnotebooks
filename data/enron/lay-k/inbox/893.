Dear Dr Lay,

2001 was an extraordinary year! As it draws to a close, I would like to
share some of my thoughts with you. First of all, I wanted to thank our
members and constituents for their active engagement during the last 12
months, which helped us to move forward in our efforts to serve as a
framework and catalyst for business and society to improve the state of the
world.

In 2001 we implemented "Forum Plus" strategy, designed to advance critical
issues on the global agenda through the creation of task forces and
initiatives that integrate business, governments, international
organizations, civil society, academics and technical experts. Today, 11
task forces are already in place. To provide an intellectual and strategic
base for these activities, we have developed and computerized - with the
help of our members and constituents - a comprehensive system for
monitoring some 200 specific items on the global agenda. This tracking
process provides a foundation for action on these ongoing challenges.

To make our foundation a true multi-stakeholder platform we have created a
number of consultative councils (e.g. with NGOs, world religious leaders,
academies of science, etc.) and have, at the same time, strengthened the
role of the business community inside our organization. It is worth noting
that despite the negative trends in the global economy, 2001 was a
successful year for all of our activities. This shows that even in
difficult times there is a great demand for increased interaction among
global decision-makers, and for top-level community building.

The most difficult decision the Forum had to take this year was to move our
Annual Meeting from Davos to New York in the aftermath of the tragic events
of 11 September. From 31 January to 4 February 2002, leaders from business,
governments, academia, religions, the media and civil society will have a
first opportunity to develop an integrated response to these new
circumstances.

The Annual Meeting 2002 is organized around six major challenges we are
facing as a global community:

1. Restoring Sustained Growth
2. Achieving Security, Addressing Vulnerabilities
3. Redefining Business Challenges
4. Reducing Poverty and Achieving Equity
5. Sharing Values and Respecting Differences
6. Re-evaluating Leadership and Governance

The Annual Meeting in New York will be characterized by a workshop-style
approach where all participants will have an opportunity to engage in
shared learning and to have a collective impact. The programme is designed
to stimulate discussion and provide insights that will help us better cope
with the fragility of our times. The response to our invitations has been
overwhelming: All the key personalities will be present.

Please note that this year, instead of sending Christmas cards, we have
made a donation to the Nelson Mandela Foundation to help build schools for
needy children. My 150 colleagues and I look forward to joining forces with
you in the New Year, in the spirit of entrepreneurship in the global public
interest, to "improve the state of the world." My very best wishes
accompany you in your contemplation at the end of the year and particularly
for a healthy and successful 2002.
