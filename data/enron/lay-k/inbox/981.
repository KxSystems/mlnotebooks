Hello Mamie and Papi,
 
Invitations are going out in the mail soon.   This is a quickie FYI to reserve Monday, January 21st from 12:00 to  2:00/2:30  to attend Nicholas' 4th Birthday Party.  Monday the 21st is  a R.O.B. school holiday... Martin Luther King Day.  I hope you are  both available.  I'll be in touch soon.
 
Thanks,
Robyn
