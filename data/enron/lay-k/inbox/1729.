Ken, I've left word with Rosalee, but I know you are fighting a battle with
no let up.

I want to communicate our best wishes and offer of support.  If there is
anything Spencer Stuart can do to help you in this period of crisis, please
understand you have access to the entire Houston Office at no fee.

Good luck.  Please call if there is anything we can do to support you.

Warmest regards,

Tom Simmons
