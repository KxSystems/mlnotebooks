Dear Mr. Cisneros.

Thank you very much for your kind words on the recent tragedy in Lima,
specially in a day like today. We at the Consulate appreciated a lot.
Please find attached the letter we sent just now to the Mayor's Office for
Economic Delelopment & International Trade, asking for humanitarian
assistance. If you could circulate the lleter it will help a great deal. We
sure can receive donations of medicines at the Consulate. In case people
would like to send money please mention to issued checks to "Consulate
General of Peru" .

Sincerely,

Carlos Velasco, Consul General

Mr. Ron Bernstein
Director of the Mayor's Office for Economic Development and int. Trade
Dear Mr.Bernstein,

As you may know by the news last Saturday occurred a great tragedy in Peru,
related to a large fire in downtown Lima, which killed nearly 300 persons
and caused 700 injured.

The authorities of the Government of Per? are requesting urgent humanitarian
assistance in medicines for burns and medical tolls to treat the injured.
Due to the magnitude of the situation  the Government has declared a two
days of  official mourning.

Although this tragedy is no match to the horrendous terrorist attacks of
September 11th. in New York, there is a great need for help and cooperation
to pale the suffering of the victims.

In this sense, I would appreciate very much if your Office could mobilized
any local agencies or private corporation to make donations in humanitarian
aid to be send to Lima in the next days.

On our part, the Peruvian community  have organized a gathering to collect
money and buy medicines to be held today at Marthas's Golden Palace (1755 W.
48th. Avenue) for the New Years Eve.

Thanks in advance for your cooperation,

Sincerely,

Carlos Velasco Mendiola
Consul General of Peru
