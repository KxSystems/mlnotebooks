Dear Rosalee,

Please forward to Ken. thanks.

I am attaching my cv for you to have handy. If you are restructuring
Enron in the US and overseas let me know if I can give you a hand on the
international side.

Fyi, I am currently working as a consultant for the Bunge Corp and Bunge
International, an agribusiness company that went public this year in the
US. ( stock symbol is BG.)

Regards and have a great holiday season.

Pablo Acevedo
