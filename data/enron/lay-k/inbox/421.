incorporated in Houston in 1997.  Since inception TLT, Inc. has developed
programs designed to serve low to middle income Houstonians.  Initially
operating in Southwest Houston, the development of the new CTC will enable

providing technology access and after school activities, the CTC will serve
as an extension of TLT, Inc.'s successful Alpha Career Center workforce
development and training program.  The Alpha Career Center offers free IT

to the total man."  Technology For All-Houston is proud to be a partner in
this effort.

Houston on the development of collaborative relationships with
community-based organizations serving Houston's low-income underserved
population. With each organization TFA-Houston has helped develop a
technology and program plan that will serve the needs of the community.

center.  Additionally, TFA-Houston brings other supportive and collaborative
relationships to each new CTC it helps develop.  These include the expertise
and online content resources provided by its parent organization Technology
For All (TFA) and others.

TFA-Houston is the local affiliate of TFA.  Together they have also
developed key supportive relationships with the Houston Technology Center,
The Telecom Opportunity Institute, Rice University, the Houston Children's
Museum and the Houston Area Technology Advisory Council of the Greater
Houston Partnership.   Each of these collaborative relationships help
provided added value to the support that TFA and TFA-Houston bring to local
grass roots organizations bringing technology to Houston's underserved
communities.

Community-based organizations assisted through the collaborative efforts of
TFA and TFA-Houston include local YMCAs, community centers, churches, faith
based social service agencies, community development organizations and

"Technology For All-Houston is supported in its mission to bring technology
to underserved communities by many Houston corporations, who redeploy
computers back into the community through TFA," says Will Reed, President
and CEO of TFA/TFA-Houston.  The generous support TFA's donor base of
individuals, foundations, and corporations comes from many, including
Houston Endowment, the Linda and Ken Lay family, the M.D. Anderson
Foundation, the Vivian Smith Foundation.  Corporate sponsors include Enron,
SmartForce, FYI-Net, ExxonMobil, Shell, BP and many others.  New corporate

ALLISON AND TERRORIST ATTACKS IMPACT FUNDING

Technology For All and Technology For All-Houston have both been impacted by
the important support that foundations and corporations have given to flood
relief and terrorist victim support.

To do its part, both organizations have reduced monthly operating expenses
through staff attrition, voluntary salary reductions by senior staff and
other means.  Both organizations are also working to increase both cash and
in-kind donations in an effort to weather the storm of funding reductions
brought on by the difficult events of recent months.
