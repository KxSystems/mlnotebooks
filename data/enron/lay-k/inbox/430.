=09I apologize for this e-mail being so late.  I know that probably someone=
 has already sent in an email with this comment, especially during the time=
 =09you requested the employees let you know how we could all pull together=
 to improve the outlook that the outside world has on Enron.  I had a =09ge=
ntleman on our floor a few weeks back, that told me he had worked for Enron=
 a while back, he said the most damaging thing that hurts Enron in =09the p=
ublic eye, is the fact that a person can seldom talk to the same person in =
a department more than a few times before their contact in that =09departme=
nt moves to another department or leaves. He said it gives the public a fee=
ling of insecurity in trusting a company where the employees =09move around=
 so much. I hope this doesn't upset you, I just thought I would let you kno=
w what one gentlemen told me regarding the company. I =09absolutely love th=
e foundation that you have built Enron on, and I only hope that more compan=
y's follow suit. Have a wonderful day.=20
