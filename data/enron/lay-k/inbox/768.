Mr. Lay:
=20
I would like to take this opportunity to thank you, from the bottom of my h=
eart, for all the hard work you are trying to do, and continue to try to do=
, on behalf of those of us who will always be proud to call Enron 'home'.  =
I joined Enron a short 11 months ago, and moved from the New Hampshire Publ=
ic Utilities Commission to do so, and will likely never regret taking the l=
eap. I have learned so much of value here, have broadened my horizons by or=
ders of magnitude, and worked with so many top quality people, that I canno=
t help but feel better for the experience.  I have enjoyed professional suc=
cess and satisfaction beyond my wildest dreams with Enron, and will always =
carry the confidence of having succeeded amongst the best there are in the =
business.  I cannot help but feel terrible that so many wish to lay blame w=
here it does not belong, but I can only assume that in times of crisis, lay=
ing blame may soothe nerves and provide some comfort.  Know that there are =
still many at Enron who admire the enormity of what you have done for energ=
y markets in the United States, and have never doubted your integrity.  As =
I, like many others, inevitably move on in these coming weeks and months, I=
 will leave with mainly good memories, and of course, the regret that such =
an awesome organism like Enron could not survive forever.  My prayers and t=
houghts are with you as you work so hard at preserving our core businesses,=
 and again, thank you for giving me the opportunity to have been a part of =
Enron.  I will always be proud to have worked under your direction and lead=
ership.

Best Regards,
