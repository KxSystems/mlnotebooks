Dear Mr. Lay,

I am a former Enron employee who voluntarily resigned from Enron in August
of this year to spend more time with my two young children, Avery, 2 1/2 and
Nate, 17 months.  These past few weeks have been devasting for a lot of
people.  I personally have lost over $40,000 in my 401K which I was heavily
investing in Enron stock since my first day there, February 1998.  I also
lost all of my children's college funds, $10,000.  But, I am one of the
lucky ones, I know.

The reason for this note is just to say that I think very highly of you and
know what a GOOD person you are.  I was fortunate enough to have seen you on
the Crystal Cathedrial a while back, and I know that you are a caring
Christian man.  Thanks for all your efforts to save the company.

I just thought you'd like to hear some nice words from an employee rather
than all the trash from the media!

Sincerely,

Shelly Michalk
