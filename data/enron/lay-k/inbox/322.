It only takes a moment to fill out a walk form and you will get an Enron/JDRF T-shirt for collect or donating $25 or more, and will join hundreds of Enron employees and several thousand Houstonians on the Walk.  This event will be a blast.  The Enron tent will be great with lots of good food and entertainment and everyone will have a fun time.  Parking at the walk site will be free.

If you cannot attend the Walk, please support one of your local walkers, participate in the cyber auction or join us for the Big E Caf? on Friday to participate in some of our other great fundraising activities.  We want to keep our standing as the number one walk team in the Gulf Coast area, Texas, and the entire Southern Region of the U.S., as well as in the top 10 nationally.
