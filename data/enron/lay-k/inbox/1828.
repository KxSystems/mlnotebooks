Ken:  When things settle down and you can get away, Polly and I would
love to host the Lays out here in the Sonoma Valley.  The guest house is
done on our Sonoma farm and we would love to see you.  We realize that
Aspen is always there for you, but if you want some sunshine and
wine-tasting, please don't hesitate--and calling us at the last minute
is just fine.  Last weekend, we had a square dance for about 100 people
in our large barn, with several former Texans who live here now in
attendance, and the Texans pronounced the whole event as very
authentic.  We will be doing that again next Fall, when you will be
invited, but don't wait that long.  Contact numbers:  cell phone
w/voicemail 415.264.0054; office 415.477.0155; Sonoma Farm 707.996.0286;
or email.  Best regards, Gary Hultquist
