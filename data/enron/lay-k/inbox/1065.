Dear Family,
=20
Obviously, everybody has been inundated with  frustrating, erroneous media =
stories since what seems like the very beginning of  this nightmare.  My mo=
ther-in-law, Sally Pate, called me yesterday and told  me she has been list=
ening to Rush Limbaugh everyday on the internet from 11 a.m.  to 2 p.m. (cs=
t).  Quite honestly, I haven't thought about our good ole'  friend Rush sin=
ce our incredible "NYC FAMILY TRIP" when we got to see him in  action--live=
.  So yesterday, I tuned in to see what he had to say about the  current st=
ate of Enron and its impact on the U.S. financial and political  arenas.  I=
ncredibly, the experience was refreshing because it was nice to  hear someo=
ne reporting the facts as well as disproving a lot of theories and  stateme=
nts which the media and politicians have been wrongly voicing.  His  underl=
ying message:  it's the media's job to report the news (the good, the  bad,=
 and the ugly), but it's their responsibility to report the facts and not  =
gossip.  Therefore, we as a society can accurately form opinions based  on =
truth, not lies.  =20

I've attached the following web site page which  highlights some of Rush's =
comments.

Love,
=20
David.

P.S.  KEN, I LOVE YOU AND PRAY FOR YOU  EVERYDAY.  GO KEN GO!
