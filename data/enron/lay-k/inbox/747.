  DEAR KEN ,  I JUST WANT TO WRITE YOU A SHORT NOTE TO EXPRESS HOW SORRY I AM FOR THE PAIN AND ORDEAL YOU HAVE BEEN SUBJECTED TO THESE PAST FEW WEEKS. NO MAN WHO HAS DONE SO MUCH FOR SO MANY SHOULD HAVE TO FACE DAY AFTER DAY WHAT YOU MUST BE GOING THROUGH . YOU ARE A GIANT AND A HERO IN MY EYES AND WILL ALWAYS REMAIN SO.   MY DAUGHTERS , SISTER , AND I ARE PROUD TO HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH YOU AND LINDA AND TO CALL YOU OUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY. HOPE TO SEE THE BOTH OF YOU SOON..................DON PATE
