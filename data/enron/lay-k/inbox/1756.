Dear Mr. Lay,
I don't know much about the vast world of business and i'm not extremely knowledgeable about the happenings within the corporation, but I do know about perseverance.  I understand that you made Enron the powerhouse that it is through perseverance, and no matter how difficult things are right now, Enron will return to the top.  I respect you a great deal as a businessman, and I know that you will find a way to bring the company out of these times.

Good Luck
