Dear Ken,

=09With everything that has happened in the past few weeks, I think we all =
realize how dangerous this world truly can be.  As an employee, I appreciat=
e the security measures that Enron has implemented over the years; however,=
 I think the events of September 11th show that maybe we haven't gone far e=
nough.  Although we could do little about a suicide attack from the air, th=
ere are many other types of attack we could prevent or minimize.  The Houst=
on Police Officers, around the buildings and on regular patrol, provide goo=
d basic protection.  However, in the event of a city-wide attack, the Polic=
e  would be unavailable and we would have to take some type of action ourse=
lves.  The Security firm contracted for the building lacks the training to =
respond to life and death situations.  I would recommend, and volunteer for=
, a security team comprised of Enron employees with prior military or polic=
e service.  There may come a time, God forbid, when we just have a few mome=
nts to act and the police may not be available.  If we can't defend ourselv=
es in the first few minutes of an act, it could be too late.  I served in a=
n anti-terrorist unit in the U.S. Army and have a few ideas that I think co=
uld help.  If this is in the realm of possibility, I would be happy to disc=
uss this with whomever you designate.  I do feel safe here at work but plan=
ning for the worst, before it happens, seems very prudent in these times.  =
Thanks!
