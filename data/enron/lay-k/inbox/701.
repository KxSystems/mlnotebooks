RE:	Bankruptcy for Enron?

If you and rest of Enron are going to declare bankruptcy, you MUST do
the following:

1. LAY OFF OR RETIRE AS MANY ENRON EMPLOYEES AS POSSIBLE TO CONVINCE
WALL STREET THAT YOU ARE SERIOUS!
2. FIRE/RETIRE AS MANY HIGHLY PAID EXECUTIVES AS POSSIBLE!
3. CALL RICK RICHARD OF COLUMBIA AND TALK TO HIM ABOUT HOW HE MANAGED
COLUMBIA DURING THEIR BANKRUPTCY!  LISTEN AND HEED HIS ADVICE IF HE WILL
GIVE IT TO YOU!
4. CONVINCE THE ENRON BOARD AND EXECUTIVES THAT THEY MUST DO GOOD THINGS
FOR THE RIGHT REASONS! IF YOU THINK THIS IS TOO SIMPLE A DIRECTIVE, YOU
REALLY NEED TO QUIT.
5. ELECT SOME COMPETENT PEOPLE TO ENRON'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND GET RID
OF THE SPINELESS PUPPETS YOU HAVE NOW!

IF YOU ARE AN HONEST PERSON, YOU WILL TAKE MY ADVICE AND ACT UPON IT IN
AN EXPEDITIOUS MANNER!
