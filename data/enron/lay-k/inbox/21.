Thank you again for attending last Thursday's meeting with Ken Lay.  As a follow-up to the meeting, I'm attaching a letter that outlines the five-point solution Ken discussed.  The governor and legislators need to hear from California's business leaders about a comprehensive solution that addresses the short- and long-term problems of California's energy crisis.  Please sign this letter and send it to the following key legislators -- and to any legislators with whom you have a good relationship:
	Governor Gray Davis
	Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg
	Senate President Pro Tem John Burton
	Assembly Speaker Pro Tem Fred Keeley
	Assembly Republican Leader Dave Cox
	Senator Debra Bowen

Please send me or Ken Lay a copy of the letter, and keep us updated on any feedback you receive from the governor and legislators.  Thank you for your assistance in helping advance a solution to California's energy crisis.  If you have any questions or need additional information, please call me.

Sincerely,

Karen Denne
Vice President
