Dear Ms. Lay:

Thank you for your e-mail.  Unfortunately, no one on our archives staff has
knowledge of the quote which you attribute to President Truman.  If you can
tell me where you heard the quote, I will be happy to look again.

I wish I could be more helpful.

Sincerely,

I need to verify a quote that is attributed to President Truman, which is as
follows:

	"At least people should get their facts straight before they mess them up."

I would appreciate any help that you can give me regarding this quote. Thank
You, Linda Lay
