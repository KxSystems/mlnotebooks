HEALTH POLICY DISCUSSION
Is the Pharmaceutical Revolution Paying Off?

Tuesday, January 29, 2002, 10:00 a.m.-1:00 p.m.
National Press Club - Ballroom
529 14th Street, NW - 13th Floor, Washington, D.C.

The American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research and the National Pharmaceutical Council invite you to a discussion about the costs and benefits of pharmaceuticals.

Over the past several years, questions about the value and appropriate use of pharmaceuticals have intensified nationwide. Are they worth it? Can we afford them? Federal and state policymakers need better insight on these issues as they consider ways to expand access to prescription drugs. So do employers, insurers, consumers, and health care providers who are weighing the costs and benefits of pharmaceuticals.

Discussion topics will include the effects of pharmaceutical expenditures on longevity and morbidity, as well as on depression treatment costs, and the effect of newer drugs on medical outcomes.

Please join us to learn more about recent research on the costs and benefits of pharmaceutical innovation and to discuss the economic impact these prescription drugs are having on our health care system. During lunch, an expert on pharmaceutical research will discuss the revolution in science and medicine, particularly in genomics.
