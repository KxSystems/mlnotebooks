I have been an Enron stockholder for several years  and I am very disappoin=
ted with the events of the last two weeks.  I find  the allegations of acco=
unting irregularities incredible.  I would like to  know how closely the bo=
ard had been monitoring the activities of the CFO and  whether it approved =
the partnerships that have led to the SEC investigation and  the dramatic d=
ecline in the company's stock price.  I would suggest that  the compensatio=
n of senior management may be too heavily weighted towards  bonuses (giving=
 some the incentive to manipulate the numbers to increase their  bonuses) a=
nd not heavily weighted enough towards stock options.  I would  hope in the=
 future the goals of the board and senior management will be aligned  with =
stockholders (increasing shareholder value).  While I know it is not  reaso=
n to have expected the stock price to stay in the high 80s, I consider the =
 drop in the last two weeks (apparently as the result of fraud) to be  inex=
cusable.  I believe the board owes all stockholders an explanation that  wi=
ll finally clear the air about this mess (maybe the markets will trust Enro=
n  again if it replaces evasion with candor).  Please help return credibili=
ty  and ethics to this company, which apparently are badly needed.
