What another day!!

This is hopefully the final numbers.

Immediate - 4,224

I know this doesn't seem like a big change but I can tell you my numb arms and wrists have changed hundreds of people today.  Below are some breakouts.  EA is the only group I'm aware of that still has changes to send in in the am.
