AEI IN AN INSTANT for Friday, January 11, 2002
Information on current and upcoming events, publications, and other activities of the American Enterprise Institute

RELEVANT TO THE NEWS

On January 10, the U.S. began transferring Al Qaeda prisoners from Afghanistan to a U.S. base in Cuba. Soon officials must decide how to try detainees who are suspected terrorists. A presidential order signed November 13 allows for the use of military tribunals, and a number of AEI scholars have argued in favor of the decision:
