Dear Ken,

I had the opportunity to talk to nearly all Foundation Board and Council
members. There is great enthusiasm about the decision to move next year's
Annual Meeting exceptionally from Davos to New York and, in such a way, to
underline the role of the Annual Meeting 2002 as a partnership platform to
elaborate a roadmap for the future and a comprehensive response to the
tragic events of 11 September. The key advice given was
- to make sure that we carry the spirit of Davos to New York
- that we make sure to have a strong international participation and
- that, finally, the key challenges are dealt with in a spirit of
cooperation and collaboration.
We need now your help and partnership to make sure that "Davos in New York"
becomes not only a success, but a substantial contribution to fulfill our
mission: to improve the state of the world.

We will be back for operational matters.

With warmest regards,
Klaus
