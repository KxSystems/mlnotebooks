I'm just a "Pea-On", but it's a shame to let Dynegy have the company for $8 billion dollars.  Enron is often known and admired for their creative and bright minds.  Why can't the people buy the company, we are going less than a football team.  I know certainly we are a lot smarter.  It's awful that we're getting calls from the enemy telling us to "Get out of their new building".  You help build this company, you have idea's don't just throw it away on one month of bad press.  If you give up, they will say it's always better the old way.   WE ARE ENRON, WE HAVE CLASS, AND WE DONT LAY DOWN AND DIE.  WE HAVE A SOLUTION.!!!!
