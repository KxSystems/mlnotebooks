Dear Jenny,

I refer to our phone conversation of today 12.10.01.

As Dr Lay has registered for our Energy Governors Meeting in Davos I sent
him an invitation to the Preparatory Meeting. The purpose of the
Preparatory Meeting is to brainstorm on possible topics and discussion
leaders for the programme of the Governors Meeting for Energy which will
take place from 3 to 5 February 2002, and to identify the latest trends in
the industry.

In order to prepare a successful Governors Meeting, the issue selection is
primordial. I am pleased that among the first confirmations for the
Preparatory Meeting we received confirmations from ABB Ltd, ENI SPA, Royal
Dutch/Shell, Statoil Group, Ruhrgas, EDF, Duke Energy Corporation, Engen
Petroleum Ltd, Gaz de France, some of which will be represented by their
top-executives.

As it is impossible for Dr Lay to participate at the Preparatory Meeting,
we would be most grateful if you could nominate a delegate as well as send
us his preliminary ideas on interesting issues and panellists for the
programme. Of course, I am fully aware what a long way it is to go for a
one-day meeting from Houston to Geneva.

This Preparatory Meeting is scheduled for Tuesday 6 November from 08.30 to
16.00 and will be held at World Economic Forum Headquarters in Cologny. We
would also like to invite this person to an informal dinner on the previous
evening, Monday 5 November at 19.30, at the Hotel Beau-Rivage in Geneva (13
quai du Mont-Blanc, 1201 Geneva, Tel. 41 22/716 6666).

Please find enclosed some suggested topics for your consideration.

(See attached file: issues.doc)

Should you have any questions concerning the Governors Meeting, please do
not hesitate to contact me any time.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Yours sincerely,
Christoph Frei
