Dear Kenneth:
On behalf of Credit Suisse First Boston, I would like to invite you to join
us for the PGA Tour Championship which will be held at Champions Golf Club
in Houston from Thursday, November 1st  through Sunday November 4th.
The Tour Championship is an annual event which showcases the top 30 money
winners and features one of the largest purses of the year on the PGA Tour.
Champions Golf Club, which has also hosted the Ryder Cup, the PGA
Championship, the United States Open and the United States Amateur, will
once again host the Tour Championship, following up on the extremely
successful 1999 and 1997 Tour Championships.  The field this year should be
very exciting, as it is likely to include Tiger Wood, David Duval, Phil
Mickelson, Sergio Garcia and Davis Love III.
We would like you and a guest to join us for the  3rd and 4th rounds of the
Tour Championship on Saturday and Sunday.  We will be hosting a private
hospitality chalet adjacent to the 9th green, from which you will be able to
watch the tournament or take a break from following your favorite players on
the course.  We sponsored the same chalet for the 1997 and 1999 Tour
Championships, and it provided a wonderful setting to view the players
up-close on the 9th hole, as well as provide a cool environment to enjoy
some food and drinks.
In order to assist us in our planning, we ask that you take a moment to
respond via e-mail indicating your interest by Friday, October 26th.  We
will provide additional details upon your acceptance.
We hope you will join us for this exciting event and we look forward to
seeing you there.
Sincerely,


Karen A. White on behalf of Osmar Abib
