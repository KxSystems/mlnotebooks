Last night, I opened up my Bible and found myself reading about  King
Hezekiah.  The bullet points are these:
1.  Hezekiah was  the most Godly man,
5 He trusted in Jehovah, the God of Israel; so that after  him was none like
him among all the kings of Judah, nor among them that were  before him.
  2 Kings 18:5 (ASV)
2.  The Assyrians surrounded  his city with a great army.
3.  He went to God with great faith and  honored God.
4.  God sent an angel
35 And it came to pass that night,  that the angel of Jehovah went forth, and
smote in the camp of the Assyrians  a hundred fourscore and five thousand:
and when men arose early in the  morning, behold, these were all dead bodies.
  2 Kings 19:35  (ASV)
I don't know if he intervenes like this in corporate affairs, but  if we seek
His guidance, how can we lose.  Take care of  yourselves.
Love,
Mark
P.S. If you think this would help Dad,  please send it to him.
