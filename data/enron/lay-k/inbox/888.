Dear Ken,

Several weeks ago I sent you an email regarding the amount of money you
owe me as a result of Enron's demise.  Thus far you have not responded.

Based on today's closing stock price for Enron, the current amount you
owe me and my family is now $1,171,968.00 which must be replaced in my
401K . This money you so callously destroyed was intended to pay for my
children's education and provide a retirement fund for my wife and me.
I worked for Enron for almost 19 years and I earned every bit of this
retirement.  Have you ever lived in Midland Texas where the dust blows
so thick you cannot see or breathe?  I experienced these conditions
often when I lived there while I worked for Enron.  Have you ever lived
in Minnesota and cleared snow drifts 6 feet high when the wind chill was
100 degrees below zero so you could get your children to school?  I did
many times when I lived there and worked for Enron. I could give you
more examples but I do not want to bore you.

If you have a shred of honesty or an ounce of decency left in your
miserable skin, you will refund this money to me.

Sincerely,

Neal F. Shaw
