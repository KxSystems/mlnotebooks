Mr. Lay, I have always admired the company YOU created and the corporate culture you created.

As the CFO of a public company I understand, at least somewhat, of the struggles involved in being a public company.

I certainly empathize with you during this tough time. Unfortunately people expect you to be perfect. It's also easy for people outside of Enron to throw stones. A lot of them are jealous outsiders that have been waiting for this for a long time.

Don't let them win, prove to them the power and strength of Enron and have the last laugh. Regards, and I'll be laughing with you.
