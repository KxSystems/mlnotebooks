Mark , as you know we are still doing very little trading or business in Italy , mostly back to back contracts with end users . In addition we are trying to develop a portfolio of options over sites to develop plants . I attach a short note setting out the issues that the Italian team would like to raise if the opportunity arises . Investor relations have called asking for additional information which is being sent to them .
Michael
