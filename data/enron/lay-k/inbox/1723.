Just a quick note to let you know that if your considering a charter
next summer, we are already working on quite a few.

I'm sure you'll all be pleased to know that next summer will see the
arrival of plenty of new choices, some new and some new to the charter
world.

If you have any dates in mind drop me a line.

Best regards

Nick Burleigh
