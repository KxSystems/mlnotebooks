Dear Ken:
 
When the timing is right, I would like to visit  with you (and Linda if appropriate) to discuss my idea of writing a scholarly  but lively history of Enron.  My working title is Ambition: The Rise and  Fall of Enron.  Perhaps the "Fall" is premature, but it will be revised  accordingly if a stunning comeback is achieved.  One of the advantages of a  longer book is that the last chapter will be on industry developments a year or  two out to see there things really land with or without Enron.
 
What I have in mind is a two-year research and  writing project--or longer.  It would develop your history through  Transco and then begin when John Duncan recruited you to Enron.  The  history, unlike the books we are likely to see in the next year,  would fully develop a number of energy, political economy, and corporate  culture themes.  I will, of course, bring in all the recent and  forthcoming events as the climax, but the buildup is what will distinguish  the book.  I anticipate it would be akin to "The Prize," but instead of the  "epic quest for oil, money, and power" the Enron story would be the "epic"  or "fatal" quest to create the world's leading company.
 
This is a book for history.  The operative  word is understanding.  The book is not intended to preserve Enron's  legacy or your legacy per se but to teach the world about what happened and  why.  There will be many positives in the story but there will be  negatives--maybe a lot of negatives.  I will be happy to discuss some  of my hypotheses of the negatives and sensitivities with you up  front.  I truly believe that a totally candid analysis of the situation is  the best legacy that Enron or you can bequeath to the business and public policy  world.  Personally for all of us who have been hurt, it is the best  foundation to move forward and once again hang our heads high.  The past  cannot be undone.  (And interestingly, there is a remarkable historical  precedent for what happened to Enron and you in the energy-centered story  of Samuel Insull--so you have pretty good company.)
 
I heard through the grapevine that you are thinking  of writing your own book.  That is a good idea for several reasons.   But I want to discuss what my book would be about in the hopes that I can  interview you over the course of the research and writing.  If  so, your autobiography could come after my book where you face up  to all the tough questions and have the "last say."  You would also  have a secure foundation from my book with all your  accomplishments.
 
I have about a month to finish a detailed  outline of the book and produce some writing samples.  An agent will shop  the proposal around, and we will see if the advance is enough to proceed.   (I got fairly wiped out by the crash.)  I am also investigating having  a co-author involved on the "Fall" side, while I work on the "Rise"  side.  I also might get some foundations or investors involved to make the  economics work, and the early indication is that there will be support.  A  lot of people would be very supportive of a full history rather than what  we are likely to see in the next year.
 
I have a PowerPoint presentation on the potential  book and will be happy to visit with you.  It might be better to visit at  the Huntington, but the office is fine also.  My home and work phone is  713-266-3934.
 
Best wishes,
 
- Rob
