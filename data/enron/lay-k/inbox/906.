In hopes that this email will be passed on, my best wishes to you in dealing with what your are going through.  There is not a day that passes that I do not reflect on your burdens and wish for you the best.  Having suffered a few valleys to go with my peaks, I appreciate, probably only to a limited degree, your struggle. I am confident that things will improve for you, certainly my hopes are for that.  I regret there is not more that I could do than offer my hopes and best wishes for you.  Dennis Hendrix
