Ken, this is Pat Koenig.  I just wanted to send you a quick email and let you
know you have my admiration and support ( I know it isn't much).  You have
made Enron a great company, and no matter how bad the press gets I will
always be proud to say my husband works for Enron and he works for the best,
Ken Lay.    Pat
