=09=09=09   Why I Want To Go To Congress     Carroll G. Robinson, Candidate=
 - 25th  District    The federal government must  prioritize our needs in t=
hese tight economic and uncertain times.  Congress and the President must  =
focus on strengthening our economy for both the short and long term.  The w=
orking men and women of  America as well as those now unemployed and undere=
mployed must be  provided for along with incentives to help create jobs.  O=
ur nation must maintain a strong  military and enhance homeland security, o=
ur public health system and  emergency room and trauma care system.  We mus=
t work together to improve  access to healthcare for all Americans. We must=
 immunize all of our  children; strengthen and protect Social Security, Med=
icare and Medicaid;  enact into law a real Patients' Bill of Rights, Prescr=
iption Drug  Benefit; and incentives to bring into and retain more nurses i=
n the  medical profession.  We must maintain our commitment to  access to a=
 quality education for all Americans as a cornerstone to our  nation's stre=
ngth, economic prosperity and overall quality of life.  We must have univer=
sal access to  Pre-K for all 3 and 4 year olds and every child in a public =
or charter  school should be provided a lap top or hand held computer from =
the first  day they start school. We need more teachers, smaller classes, m=
ore  construction funding and enhanced compensation for educational  profes=
sionals.  Housing, Transportation,  Environmental Protection and the Infras=
tructure necessary to sustain our  community must also be among our priorit=
ies.  I want to work with other elected  officials to mitigate flooding and=
 provide more parks, libraries and  other quality of life amenities to ensu=
re that our community remains  safe, clean, prosperous and livable.  [IMAGE=
