Dear Ken, 
While receiving a report from Paula Rieker just now on the October 30 board meeting which I missed, I reiterated what I said in the previous board meeting.  Namely, Paul Volcker and I have for several years co-chaired the Hong Kong Economic Cooperation Committee (now called the Hong Kong-U.S. Business Council).  He and I have known each other for almost fifteen years.  If you want but fail to reach him, please let me know and I shall be happy to try.  
Kind Regards, 
Ronnie Chan
