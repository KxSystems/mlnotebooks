This is the 3rd time that I have attempted to get an
answer to the following question:

Has or was more than one petition been filed before
the bankruptcy court for severance or financial relief
for terminated employees.

At the time of the terminations, we were told in a
group meeting that the $4500 requested and approved by
the judge was the first of several petitions before
the bankruptcy judge for severance on behalf of the
terminated employees.

To date, we have had no response to indicate what, if
any, other petitions are before the court.  An answer
to this question will influence our actions on
individual claims to the court as well as class action
and individual lawsuits.

Would someone within the organization please give us
the courtesy of a response via e-mail or FAQ's?

Since primarily lower level employees were affected by
the terminations, it would seem that some goodwill and
positive PR could be generated by attempting to show
that you did not totally desert us in the process of
lining your pockets.

=====
Sincerely,

June Walker
