Dr. Lay (in care of - Rosalee Fleming):

We are very pleased to have you participate in our "Markets in
Transition" symposium on January 10, 2001.  I will be sending additional
information to you, but I wanted to give you some "advance warning" on a
couple items.

We will be putting together a symposium brochure in December.  As part
of that, we would like to get a biography of you (about 200-250 words in
length), and a photograph.  We will need this by around the first of
December, so I wanted to give you a little advance notice.

I will contact you after Thanksgiving to provide more details around
this event.  If you have any questions in the meanwhile, feel free to
contact me.

Brad Burke
Associate Director, Rice Alliance
