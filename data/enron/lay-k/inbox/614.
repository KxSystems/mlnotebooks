Dear Ken,

I am a friend of your daugther Elizabeth while she was in Argentina and
I am applying for a job with Eli Lilly in Indianapolis as a  Latin
American Development Manager. I would like to know if there is a
posibility to have a recomendation letter from you since I know you are
from the Board of Directos from Lilly.

I have worked for Enron South America in Argentina and Brazil and
currently runing mu own company. If you believe this is possible just
let me know. I am attaching my cv to you.

Many thanks Ken.

Sincerely,

Pablo Acevedo
