Ken -- As you can see from the attached schedule, the level of media interest in Enron's earnings has grown considerably in the past 18 months.  As a result, we have developed a fairly rigorous schedule to provide interviews with the main broadcast, wire and print media.   

This quarter, we will do the broadcast interviews with CNBC, CNNfn and Bloomberg TV from an office on the 32nd floor trading floor, rather than in the Board room.  We think that this is an optimal location because we want the backdrop to show that you're back in the midst of the action.

Given the recent events, you are likely to get questions about security, energy infrastructure and impact of Sept. 11 on Enron.  We have compiled a Q&A/messaging document, which covers these issues and other earnings-related topics.  I will send the Q&A later today.

Mark Palmer or I will meet you following the analyst call, and we will go to EB3241 for the broadcast interviews, then come back to your office to place the calls to the wire and print reporters.

Also, Vijay Vaitheeswaran of the Economist is in town this week, and he would like to interview you about where Enron is headed under your direction.  He is scheduled to meet with you for 45 minutes at 1 p.m.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thank you.
Karen
