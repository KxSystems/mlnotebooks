  SSBSC  TO KEY VOTE UPCOMING TRADE VOTE IN  HOUSE
SBSC Chairman Karen Kerrigan  sent a letter to Congress this week noting that SBSC would make the upcoming  vote (scheduled for December 6) on trade promotion authority (TPA) an SBSC "key  vote," noting that "a vote for TPA is a vote for small business."  Kerrigan wrote: "I wanted to take this  opportunity to express how vital passage of TPA is to America's small businesses  and entrepreneurs?  America's small  business and entrepreneurial sector are the engines of U.S. economic growth, but  our entrepreneurs will require a level playing and access to the world  marketplace if they are to maintain the level of job creation, innovation and  vitality that is so integral to the health of our overall economy.  Trade,  and specifically TPA, is a matter of common sense, sound economics and just  happens to be in our national  interest."
 
SBSC strongly encourages our  members and supporters to contact their U.S. Representatives and urge them to  support TPA for President Bush.  A  great place to visit with the latest daily updates on the upcoming vote is the  Progress for America (PFA) website. SBSC has been closely working with PFA on  TPA and a host of other issues critical to the health and vitality of small  business.  Please visit their new  website, where you can sign a resolution in support of TPA for President Bush,  or send an e-mail message to your U.S. House Member.  You can send a message now by linking  to:  www.progressforamerica.org /1101/
