Strategies for Success in Oil Refining
20 and 21 March 2002, The Hatton, London

Dear Mr K.L. Lay,

I though you might want to be informed about SMi's Strategies for Success in
Oil Refining Conference, so I've outlined below an overview of this event
which is taking place in March.

With uncertain markets and shrinking margins in the refining industry it's
never been more important to reduce costs to an absolute minimum. SMi's
conference, "Strategies for Success in Oil Refining" on 20 and 21 March 2002
will identify the most important challenges facing the industry and analyse
the measures companies are pursuing to improve performance. Discover how you
can make your refinery profitable in the current climate despite all the
contradictory evidence.
