On Thursday, May 25 you were repaid $2,535,786.72  from the refinance of Da=
vid's home ($1mm) and my home ($1,535,786).   We forwarded the funds to pay=
down your personal Bank of Amercia (BA) LOC.   The Family Partnership had t=
o borrow from your personal line at BA $200,000 to  cover the $588k cash ca=
ll for SRE properties.  With today's closing prices,  the Family Partnershi=
p's available BA line is between $25k-$50, which is an  estimate because mu=
tual funds don't post their NAVs until around 5pm (Central  time).  That ma=
kes the Partnership's  total payable to KLL/LPL  personal line at $1,303,50=
0.

I contacted the guys regarding the BBT Fund (Bass  family).  Per our conver=
sation, I told them that the timing was bad,  but we did not want to miss o=
ut before they close the fund.  I indicated  that our initial investment wo=
uld be the following: KLL/LPL personal $250,000;  KLL & LPL Investments, Lt=
d. $100,000; Foundation ? (possibly  $100,000).  The initial investment amo=
unt for the partnership, and  possibly the foundation, are about as low as =
we can go if we want to  get into the fund.  I am aware that the Foundation=
 is waiting to as  long as possible to pay out any contributions os I wasn'=
t sure if we wanted to  make something happen there.  Also, I indicated tha=
t we would prefer  to fund as late as possible, which looks like July  .  I=
f we decide on doing something in the foundation they  have an Offshore Par=
tnership to eliminate the tax implications of UBIT.   The Offshore Partners=
hip is run exactly the same as the Onshore version, but is  unitized and pa=
ys a dividend rather than distributions to the investors.   Let me know if =
the amounts (above) to invest are okay with you and if you want  anything i=
n the Foundation.
