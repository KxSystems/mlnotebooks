Ken/Greg:

I wish you both the best as you work through the next few weeks. I have a sincere and eager interest in remaining to ensure that Enron remains a viable and competitive force in the energy sector and become the leading transaction provider of gas and power trading and marketing.

If you need an analyst to assist you in reaching this goal, please let me know.

If you need references, I am confident that John Sherriff or Jeff Kinneman in my current group will provide detailed information on my behalf. Moreover, I am able
to provide other contacts within the firm to provide additional information if needed.

Best wishes in your future endeavors!
