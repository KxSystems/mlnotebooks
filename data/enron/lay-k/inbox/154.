Prescribing Ritalin: Who Decides?Doctors or Lawyers?

Monday, June 18, 2001, 9:30 a.m.*Noon
Wohlstetter Conference Center, Twelfth Floor, AEI

     The medical community has undertaken a vigorous debate about attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). At one extreme are doctors, psychologists, and others who question whether clinicians are "medicalizing" childhood.   At the other pole are doctors who eagerly prescribe medications for youngsters at the slightest hint of trouble. Nonetheless, while over diagnosis and over prescribing are legitimate concerns, the consensus among mental health professionals is that ADHD exists and that stimulant therapies like Ritalin are effective.
     A legal debate has now been added to the medical one. Trial lawyers representing a class of parents whose children were diagnosed with ADHD have filed lawsuits in several states against the maker of Ritalin and the American Psychiatric Association.  They allege that the two conspired to "create" a disease to hype the benefits of the drug.  This conference will include an overview of the ADHD controversy and an examination of the implications of the ADHD litigation, followed by a question and answer period.
