Ken, 
I'm an ex-Enron employee who was with Houston Pipe Line & later with Enron Gas Services & I want you to know I do not hold you responsible for the situation we are all currently in. There is no one else I would rather have trying to make this a successful company again than yourself. I have seen you in action ever since the merger & I know you can do it. I have attached a copy of a letter that I have sent to certain members of Congress.  
Charge on & Best of luck 
Jim Jurek
