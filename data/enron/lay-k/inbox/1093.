HEALTH POLICY DISCUSSION
The OxyContin "Crisis"-Who's to Blame?

Thursday, February 7, 2002, 10:30 a.m.-12:30 p.m.
Wohlstetter Conference Center, Twelfth Floor, AEI
1150 17th Street, N.W., Washington, D.C.

The pharmaceutical drug OxyContin is a potent pain reliever, often the only help for hundreds of thousands of patients who suffer serious, relentless aches. The drug has recently been in the spotlight for its use as a street narcotic, sold on the black market and responsible for addiction and overdose deaths. In nearly all cases OxyContin addicts are established substance abusers and not patients suffering from pain. In order to obtain a heroin-like high, these addicts crush the pill to make it more powerful and fast-acting.
	The Drug Enforcement Administration and several state attorneys general are blaming "aggressive marketing" by OxyContin's manufacturer (Purdue Pharma) for what has been called an "Oxy abuse epidemic." Trial lawyers are filing class action suits against the company. Who is responsible for the abuse of OxyContin? This AEI discussion will include:
