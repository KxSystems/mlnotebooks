In some areas of ENE 2 people are doing the work 1/2 person could do. Is this magnified throughout ENE as numerous people in other departments have claimed? Shouldn't we be reassessing our manpower needs  on a broader basis to cover the real needs? This would result in a reduction of manpower, but employees without real jobs to do have low moral which adversely impacts the whole company.  The ultimate result would be a stronger company both financially & professionally.
