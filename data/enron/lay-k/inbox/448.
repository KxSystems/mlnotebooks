Ken,

I am responsible for managing Enron's banking relationships, and have been speaking to Rosalee about reserving time on your calendar for meetings with our top 4 banks.  Given the uncertainty and tightness in the credit markets,  Andy, Ben and I have discussed the importance of getting you and Andy in front the senior members of management at JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, CSFB, and Deutsche Bank.  We are expecting all of these institutions to play an important role in achieving our year-end financing plan. 

Rosalee has indicated that you may have time available on Tuesday, November 6th to meet in New York.

Please let me know if you can make your calendar available for these meetings.

Thank you,

Kelly
