PW line has a deficit of about $2.1 million.  We are on day 3.   We might have to fund the account around $2 million if it doesn't cure itself by  tomorrow.  Can we use the Enron line again now that it is paid-off or would  you rather use one of the other lines?  BA has approximately $5.9  million available, which has the most availability of all the lines.
 
Please advise.
