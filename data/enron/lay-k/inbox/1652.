Mr. Lay,

I just want to voice a note of encouragement and appreciation to you during this unsettling period.  I don't know you personally, but under your leadership Enron has achieved great things, and regardless of the outcome of the current situation (which I fully expect to be positive) you should know that a lot of us appreciate your contributions and leadership.

As an employee for over 11 years, I've seen a lot at Enron, both good and bad.  But in my career I've been with a number of major companies, and none have been as exciting as Enron.

I'll keep it short--your time is valuable.  Hang in there, we're behind you.  And thanks for the leadership--it's a truly rare commodity.

Mike Coleman
