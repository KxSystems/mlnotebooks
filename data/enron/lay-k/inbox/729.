RE: Houston Mayor's Race - The Home Stretch 
Orlando Sanchez is locked in a tough run-off election, and he needs your help now to cross the finish line strong and become Houston's next mayor. 
In case you haven't heard, both Presidents Bush have endorsed Orlando for Mayor, and HUD Secretary Mel Martinez and Labor Secretary Elaine Chao will be in Houston to help campaign for Orlando.  That's all great news for the Sanchez Campaign, but what will matter most is that Houstonians turn out at the polls this Saturday and help Orlando finish strong and finish first! 
If you're a Houstonian, your vote, your financial support and your volunteer efforts are needed most.  Remember, the election is THIS SATURDAY (12/1/01). 
The rest of us can lend a hand to Orlando Sanchez by making a contribution to his campaign today and by encouraging our friends, family and business associates in Houston to go to the poll and cast a vote for real leadership for America's fourth largest city! 
Please take a moment right now and make a contribution to Orlando's campaign online at https://www.campaigncontribution.com/donors_info.asp?id=1932&db=1 .  Or, mail your contribution to Orlando Sanchez Campaign, 3100 Timmons Lane, Suite 100, Houston, Texas 77027. 
Or, equally important, volunteer to help Orlando turn out the vote.  Jump to the "Get Involved" 
section of his web site at http://www.orlandosanchez.com/get_involved.htm . 
Please forward this message along to as many of your friends, family and co-workers as possible.  The run-off election is just a few short days away.  Please do what you can to help ensure Orlando finishes strong and finishes first on December 1.

Tony Garza
