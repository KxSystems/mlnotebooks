Mr. Lay, as an employee about to enter his 18th year with Enron, I am deeply concerned about the situation our company is currently in.  Although I have every confidence that we will recover, could I respectfully ask that employees be given a daily update on what steps are being taken to reverse the trend that the company is in?  I realize that you and your team are diligently working to correct it, but I believe it would help morale if employees could hear on a more frequent basis specifically what our management is doing.  Anyone who monitors ENE on the stock market has been reading numerous negative articles and headlines, and it would be reassuring to know that there is some potentially positive news.
 
Thank you for listening.
