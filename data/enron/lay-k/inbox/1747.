 Dear Kenneth,    As you know, FactSet has always taken great pride in its =
close relationships with its clients.  By providing around-the-clock consul=
ting services, extensive product training and foregoing contracts as a part=
 of our business model, we always try to put the users needs first.   Along=
 these lines, we also recognize the importance of communicating more effect=
ively the value added enhancements we continue to make to FactSet. We soon =
plan to include the use of email to notify you of upcoming events and new p=
roducts that you may find of interest.  Also planned is distribution of our=
 quarterly newsletter, Query , electronically so that the valuable informat=
ion covered gets to you as quickly and efficiently as possible.   We respec=
t your privacy regarding  marketing messages via email.  If you welcome per=
iodic email from FactSet regarding product news, upcoming webcasts and trai=
ning shows, there is no need to respond to this email. You will be automati=
cally enrolled in this program, and will have the ability to opt-out at any=
 time.   While a number of our clients have already requested promotional m=
aterials electronically, we recognize that not everyone feels the same way.=
  If you do not wish to receive email from us in the future, please click h=
ere  now to permanently remove yourself from our email list.   We hope you =
find FactSet's use of email to enhance our client relationships beneficial.=
 If you have any questions regarding FactSet's plans to keep you informed v=
ia email, please feel free to contact me at 203.356.3797 or dfrankel@factse=
t.com . Thank you for your continued use and support of FactSet!   Sincerel=
y, David A. Frankel Vice President, Director, Marketing   =09
