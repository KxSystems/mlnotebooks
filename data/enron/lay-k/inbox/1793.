Ken,

I greatly appreciate your reply, I also agree that the merger was the best alternative, given the circumstances. It saddens me to think that I will not be working for Enron, I had planned to retire from here.  I pray that you will be at peace with your decision and that you will have a happy retirement, put it all behind you and know that you did everything you could and we have a great amount of respect and appreciation for you.  We will definitely miss you and your leadership.  I hope that Dynegy appreciates the value that they are obtaining and the gift of the talented and innovative employees that they will be getting.  Everything will work out for the best.

Thank you again for your response.

Always dedicated,

Delia:

I very much appreciate your e-mail and agree with most of what you said.  But for very practical reasons, the management and the Board decided a merger with Dynegy was the best alternative for Enron.

Thank you,

Ken

Dear Mr. Lay,

My manager and I were discussing the possibility of doing a fund raiser for Enron.  We contributed an absorbant amount of money to charities this year and last, would it not be possible to raise money to help our company.  Do a little belt tightening.  We could do without the Christmas party, do without our bonuses and next year at this time, when we are back on top, it would be a sweeter glory knowing that the employees helped turn everything around.  I have spoken with my HR rep and several other employees about this possibility and we feel that we would be able to raise a substantial amount of money.  Please let me know what your view on this would be and we will work on what steps we need to take to make it happen.

Thank you for your time.
