RE: Employee Severance

Enron Corp.
Office of the Chairman
1400 Smith Street
Houston, TX 77002

Attention: Kenneth Lay

Enron has in place a severance policy that entitles
all terminated employees a benefit that is based on
length of service and amount of pay.

In the days leading up to the bankruptcy filing, then
again during floor meetings at the time of
termination, Enron representatives clearly stated that
the company would be seeking payment of the severance
policy for terminated employees.  This was to follow
the advanced payment of $4,500 for these benefits.

However, severed employees have not been contacted by
Human Resources representatives to advise them of the
amount of severance benefits they are eligible to
receive as stated in the policy.  They have also not
been informed of Enron's intention to pursue these
payments through the court.

Enron has since informed current employees that they
intend to work with the court to establish provisions
for additional retention and severance for current
employees.

Since these payments are crucial for severed employees
to assess their financial situation, we are asking
Enron to promptly respond to the following five
questions:

1) Will the Board approve the severance plan in place
or another plan of severance?

2) Will this be the same plan that is being put
together for current employees that may be severed at
a later date?

3) What day will the board be acting on this plan?

4) What day will the plan be presented to the
bankruptcy court?

5) Since employees have not been informed of the
status of their benefit, will application for state
unemployment benefits cease payment of the severance
benefit?  Will Enron waive that stipulation?

In the event that Enron will not be seeking additional
severance for terminated employees, we are asking that
Enron answer the following questions:

1) By what day will a Human Resources representatives
contact each employee with the amount of severance
they were eligible to receive at the time of their
termination?

2) How do employees access supporting documentation
needed for filing a proof of claim form through the
bankruptcy court?  This would include company policy
manuals and employee files.


Respectfully,


Ezzatollah (Ezzy) Sadrerafi
