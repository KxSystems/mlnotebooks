Dear Ken,

I am perhaps the newest European Enron employee- I started on Nov 5th 2001 as an extremely ambitious 28 year-old Associate.  
It hasn't worked out this time but I hope to work with you in the future - I am extermely serious about this.  To this end  I enclose my CV - highlights include Masters from Oxford, Chartered Accountant (CFA), Shell, DB, Aquila and Enron.

Please reply to:  gtamber@yahoo.co.uk or call +44 7879 890 454 

Goodluck Ken.
