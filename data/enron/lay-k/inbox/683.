Dear Warren Electric Group friends,


On September 11, 2001 at 8:45 AM (EST), the United States of America was
forever changed!

The despicable acts of war by unknown cowardly terrorists have touched
each one of us very, very deeply -- beyond mere words.

For those of us that have family members or themselves that lived
through and fought for our freedom in World War II, Korea, Vietnam,
and/or Desert Storm, I am sure they thought that it was not possible for
these ghastly deliberate acts of terrorism to really happen on American
soil! BUT, it really did happen, and we must not forget that it did! God
rest all those souls...it really happened; and the truth is it could
happen again anywhere, anytime.

Americans must not panic because that would be allowing "Evil" to win!
We are mourning the hundreds of lives lost in this devastation. We are
Angry. We are Resolute and we want JUSTICE! Our home has been attacked!

Our American leaders show great strength under pressure proving that the
world's leader - the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA is still the world's
leader in democracy and is still on duty! This horrific act of
aggression did not and will not stop democracy!

God Bless our leaders - give them the strength of mind, wisdom, and
character to get through this time of crisis and beyond.

We the people of America whether we are from small towns, metropolitan
cities, the country, or living abroad are bonded together - UNIFIED -
standing shoulder-to-shoulder together as ONE! We will survive, we will
PREVAIL!

My mother, Claude, has told me many times about the day she and Dad
found the first Warren - Houston building. They were looking through the
window of a building just a few blocks from where our headquarters is
today, a car came to a screeching halt, a man jumped out of the car and
screamed, "they've just bombed Pearl Harbor"! The day was December 7,
1941 - 59 years and 9 months ago...that day has always been referred to
as "the DAY that lives in Infamy".... well, September 11, 2001 is going
to be a day remembered in an even more dramatic way!

As we gather our thoughts, prayers and plans for our future we the
owners of the company want all of you to know how much we love each and
everyone of you and your families. No matter what our futures holds the
people we have worked with side-by-side and have gotten to know are very
special to us. God bless each one of you.

Now as our President, George W. Bush, turns his attention outward to the
resolution of this crime against the civilized world we MUST do our
part! We must not allow chaos or panic to take hold!

It is time to redouble our commitment to the United States of America
and for all She stands. As we return to our jobs we will work harder; we
will donate blood to help New York and Washington D.C.; we will
sacrifice without complaint; we will prove to those that would crush and
bury the USA that this CANNOT be done. Not by King George, nor by
slavery, the Kaiser, Hitler, nor Krushaev and most assuredly not by this
latest cowardly gang of thugs.

The United States of America IS strong and we will make Her even
stronger with every passing day. Be proud to be an American. Be proud to
be free.

GOD BLESS AMERICA - OUR HOME SWEET HOME !!!!!!!!!!!!
