Ken,  I just wanted to say thanks for all that you and Enron have done for =
me.  I know you trusted people close to you and they let you down for that =
Im sorry.  I have always believed in you and what you stand for.  I  know i=
t took tremendous courage to do what you have done over the last couple of =
weeks.  Whether the people at Enron like it or not I believe you put us fir=
st.  I trust that your decision was the right thing given the circumstances=
. Yes, Im deeply hurt by the last month but the true spirit of Enron will l=
ast within me forever.   I started at this company a mid level IT Administr=
ator and I am now a seasoned Director level technologist and leader.  I hav=
e had 4 promotions in the last 5 1/2 years.  I have been challenged by this=
 environment.  I believe that I can go anywhere and be successful because o=
f meeting those challenges.  No where else could have provided me these opp=
ortunities. In return Im going to stay committed and have faith that due to=
 that committment the Enron spirit will live on.  With all the bad I wanted=
 to remind you of the good. My years of employment with Enron have been the=
 best of my career.  No matter what happens I know I will be fine. I truly =
wish you and your family the best. =20

Take Care
Mike Croucher
