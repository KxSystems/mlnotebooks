I have been reading about the current "flap" you have been dealing with and I was just writing to tell you "DON'T LET THE TURKEYS GET YOU DOWN'!!  I
know you know it but sometimes it helps to hear it from someone else.

 Good luck and keep your chin up. I am sure it wll work out.

                                  Sandy
