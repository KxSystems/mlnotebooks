Memo to Disaster Relief Advisory Board (persons that do not have email
will receive correspondence by fax)
---------------

Thank you so much for your enthusiasm and your ideas.  Many things have
been suggested that I had not thought of, but I think before we put
these on a bulletin board we should issue passwords to protect the
information, for that matter, the advisory board members.

We will call you on a landline to give you your password.  This will
take a little time with so many advisory board members.

Another thing that will take a little time is insuring the security of
the group in any meeting we might have.  Dr. Wainerdi has kindly offered
to have the meeting in a secure site within the Texas Medical Center and
Ambassador Djerejian and I feel best to re-schedule the meeting that we
were talking about holding at the Baker Institute at 2 p.m. on Friday
September 28.  Instead, we will get some advice from the FBI as to
whether there are any immediate local security concerns and if so, how
best to mitigate them.  Meanwhile, we will get everyone a password so
that we can do some secure planning before a face-to-face meeting is
ever held.  This will make better use of the time of busy people.

I thought I would answer a couple critical questions that have been
asked:

Why Defense of Houston?  Isn't there already enough overlap of agencies?

We conceived of Defense of Houston as mainly a medical group to improve
the medical response in case of any terrorism or other medical
disasters.  I have been working here for 9 years and have been involved
in some disasters like the flood, but no one here has ever been in
anything like what happened at the World Trade Center.  At best we can't
say with confidence that we are prepared.  Indeed, every single national
study (and there have been 3 in the past year alone) says that we are
not prepared and points to communication, coordination, training, and
public education as the most pressing needs.

We have enough trouble keeping communication open with our sister
institutions  (Memorial Hermann Hospital, St. Luke's Episcopal Hospital,
the Texas Heart Institute, and M.D. Anderson Cancer Center), and we know
from experience that communication with the rest of the medical center,
and with doctors and hospitals outside the medical center, is harder
still.  Despite the outstanding efforts of the Houston Fire Department's
Medical Director, Dr. David Persse, communication is not always smooth
and equipment and training are not optimal, even though they are better
than in most cities.

Since we need to do more, the question is who should do it, and how.
The doctors and scientists in the medical center don't have all the
answers, but have learned over the past few days that some great common
sense questions and solutions have come from non-technical people
outside the medical center.  Moreover, every member of this advisory
board is a stake holder and has the right to know if the medical
response system is adequate.

Moreover, the advisory board members are leaders in the community, both
directly and indirectly, are educators.

Finally, a large and representative group will help medical center
institutions not only by their advice, their questions and needs, but by
their support of the work we are doing.  This includes the need to more
research to develop better sensors, vaccines, and therapies, all which
will benefit from federal support and federal support for such projects
- in the Texas Medical Center and beyond - is more likely and the public
and its leaders are united and one day speak out.

Defense of Houston is not intended compete with or distract the other
important groups work in this area which include the Houston Task Force
on Counter-Terrorism at the Baker Institute (leaders are members of the
Defense of Houston and vice-versa) or the many important city, county,
state and federal agencies.  Defense of Houston is an attempt to improve
our medical readiness.  Because we ourselves could be targets, we have
to know a little bit about how these other agencies can protect us and
how we can help protect ourselves.

More specifically, we expect to leave all the policy issues to the
Houston Task Force on Counter-Terrorism.  This would include the
"upstream" issues such as analysis of the root causes of terrorism, of
diplomatic efforts, of inter-agency cooperation, of leadership of
public-private efforts, etc.  The Baker Institute also plays an
important educational role.

In contrast, Defense of Houston will focus on optimizing the medical
response, and secondarily, on public education that is part of the
mission of the medical schools here.

Thirdly, Defense of Houston is interested in bolstering the capability
of the medical institutions to conduct the kind of critical research in
bio-sensors, public health surveillance, coordination of emergency care,
increased understanding of biological and chemical agents and means to
inactivate them, to vaccinate against them, and to treat victims.

We have lots of news that will be available as soon as you have your
password.

Thanks again for your interest.  I am now convinced that we can make
Houston the safest city in the country.

Sincerely,

Ward
