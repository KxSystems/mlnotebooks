Labor Conditions and Worker Rights in China and Hong Kong

Monday, January 28, 2002, 3:00-5:00 p.m.
Wohlstetter Conference Center, Twelfth Floor, AEI

China's supply of cheap labor has drawn textile and electronic manufacturing jobs from the United States and many developing Asian countries. These jobs have not necessarily brought prosperity to the majority of Chinese workers-in fact, discontent has grown. An excess of unemployed rural workers and an increase in laid-off workers from closed or privatized state-owned enterprises has produced an angry and demoralized workforce. Worker demonstrations have been mounted in all parts of China, many regarding corruption in factory management. Some China watchers view this worker unrest as a recipe for instability and eventual chaos. The members of this panel suggest a possible solution: independent worker organizations in which workers can protect their own interests and contribute to the solution of some of the nation's economic problems, particularly corruption, through a democratic process. Panelists will also address related issues in Hong Kong.
