Dear Mr. Lay,  I have been an Enron employee for the past 15 years.  I just thought you should know that there are employees who are extremely supported of you.  We appreciate the fact that you are not laying us off.  We appreciate the efforts you are making to correct problems we have in our Company and we have the utmost confidence in YOU as C.E.O.  I will continue to keep you in my prayers and I believe that Enron WILL persevere!  I feel so strongly about this that I recently purchased additional shares.  Hang in there Mr. Lay!
