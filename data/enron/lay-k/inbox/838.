I was just reading over some verses I have posted around my cube and I noticed the Luke 10:27 "You shall love the Lord you God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your strength and with all your mind...."
All of the sudden, it wasn't "You gotta do this...." But God saying, "I'm gonna love you so much you are going to love me with all your heart, all your soul, and with all your strength, and with all your mind.... I'm gonna make you fall in love with me!" 
I was just thinking how much God is "winning my heart" in all of this. 
I JUST LOVE Jesus, don't you???!!!! There REALLY is NONE like our GOD!!!!!! 
Hope you heard about how God is ministering to your "flock". The Astros and Enron Field are hosting a Job Fair. KSBJ is somehow participating and also offering ministerial services for coping. They are in such good hands. God is so good. The Good Shepherd.
