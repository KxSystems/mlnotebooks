Free Trade vs. States' Rights:
Globalization and the Challenge to Local Democratic Government

 N.W., Washington, D.C. 20036

Even as America is experiencing a revival of states' rights, globalization =
has begun to strain domestic federalism arrangements. State policymakers ar=
e finding their authority constrained by the rules of international trade o=
rganizations. At the same time, the states' increasingly active role in for=
eign policy is making it more difficult for the United States to project a =
single, coherent policy in the international arena. Are federalism and glob=
alization headed for a collision? How should we reconcile the conflicting v=
alues of economic efficiency, state autonomy, and democratic governance? Ho=
w should states respond to the challenges of globalization? What role shoul=
d the federal government play in ensuring that international organizations =
(such as the WTO) and global capitalism do not undermine state autonomy? Ma=
rk Gordon - whose paper "Democracy's New Challenge: Globalization, Governan=
ce, and the Future of American Federalism" will soon be released by Demos -=
 will be joined in the discussion by Michael Greve and two distinguished gu=
est panelists.
