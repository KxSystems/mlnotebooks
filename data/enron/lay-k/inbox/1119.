Dear Uncle Ken and Aunt Linda,
=20
Hi! I'm so sorry for what is all that's happening to ya'll.  I hope God wil=
l help ya'll in so mnay ways to keep ya'll spirit's up through these rough =
times.  I pray that God will help you, Uncle Ken through the things your co=
mpany is going through.  I want to call you so many times, but didn't becau=
se I don't want to distract you from your valuable time away from this big =
problem you are going through.  My Political Science teacher last week said=
 something about Enron, I immediately raised my hand since I was the only o=
ne in the class who knew what Enron was and what is kinda happening to it. =
 I thought that was really interesting to tell you. Oh, plus I used Enron f=
or an example for my trial essay I had to write for my writing class. I hop=
e you don't mind that. Well, Aunt Linda I have a new boyfriend, Zeke. We've=
 been dating for now over a month and two weeks. He's awesome! When I get a=
  chance I'll send a pic! ture to you of him. I hope all is well with both =
of you. I LOVE and MISS ya'll both!!! Take care and God Bless!!!!=20

       Love,=20
Emily K. Phillips
