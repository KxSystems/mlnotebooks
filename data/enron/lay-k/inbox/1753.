Mr. Lay:

I am Marilynne Haws one of your stockholders.  I am 70 years old and was
quite proud of my Enron stock..  Part of the stock I inherited and part I
bought.  I do not have a lot of money, so loosing money is very terrifying
for me.  The dishonesty  of Enron has been a disapointment to me.  I put the
blame entirely on you as you should have been watching the store instead of
politicking.  I still like to believe that in your case it was ego, not
dishonesty that caused you to allow this mess to happen.
I am ashamed of you as l leader of industry, as a Republican and I just hope
that you are not a Methodist.

Marilynne A. Haws
