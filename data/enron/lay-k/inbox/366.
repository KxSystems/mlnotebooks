Dear Advisory Board members:

Dr.Mark Wheelis, PhD emailed the following:

Inhaling anthrax can be spread by aerosol only by droplets small enought to
penetrate into the alveoli--approximately 5 micrometers diameter.
Does not spread from person to person. HEPA filters will remove it,
but not normal air filters.

From Reports from Russia, it is evident high temp. (air circulation) will
kill Anthrax. I worked as Chief Engineer in Texaco and Shell buildings in
Houston. I am familiar with filteration and heater systems. I request a
discussion may be arranged among the interested Advisory Board Mebers to
review this topic.
