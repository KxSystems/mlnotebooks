Mr. Lay,
 
I hope this note finds you in good health.   I wish you and your family a happy and healthy New Year.
 
I am currently working with a group of former Enron  employees negotiating with several entities to join one of their  organizations to trade various commodities (excluding power and  gas).  A couple of the entities have shown definitive interest in  hiring the group, but our employment at Enron and employment contracts have  created significant issues.  In order for us to continue with the  discussions and the possibility of employment, we have been asked to provide a  letter from Enron representing that we have been released from the obligations  of our various employment contracts, specifically the non-compete  provision.
 
I know you very interested in assisting former  Enron employees in succeeding with their lives and careers.  I would very  much appreciate your personal help and support in this  matter. 
 
I spoke with Rosalee yesterday (January 10th) and  she suggested I email this note to you with the names of the other members of  this group that may have issues with their employment contracts.  The  individuals other than myself are Bryan Burnett, Jeff Ader and Mark  Bernstein.  
 
Timing as always is important, I will follow up  with Rosalee Monday afternoon to determine a time that I can go the office to  pick up the letters.
 
I know you have tremendous demands on your time  during this difficult period, I sincerely appreciate your attention and  support.  As before, if there is anything I can do for you or family,  please do not hesitate to contact me.  
 
Thank you,
 
Edward Ondarza
