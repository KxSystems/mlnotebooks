Dear Ken,

I am writing as a former London employee whose last day in the office was
Friday 30th November.
I don't know if you are aware but this time of year is the tightest time of
year for recruitment in London both in the temporary and permanent market
place.
I am confident in the skill-sets that I can bring to the current market
place but the average job search takes 2-3 months and unfortunately I do not
have the financial security to enable me to live through that time. That is
why I am asking for a small donation of ?1000 to help me pay my mortgage and
to see me through Christmas.

This e-mail is cheeky but I felt that I had nothing to lose and I hope that
you will respond positively to it.
Regards
Jane
