Subject:	THIS IS A SURVEY - ONE QUESTION


To answer your survey question,  I don't need these services period! I will not use the click at home portal. I wish I could.  If I could send my computer back and recover all the monies I've  lost because of click at home  I would!  WHY? Click at home promised broad band to all employes. As of this date no attempt to provide that service to people like myself has been made. How can I make such a statement? Because broadband has been available in my area via satellite since the birth of click at home and I still do not have a subsidized service! A basic internet line is just too slow to justify doing business at home!  I purchased this computer with the understanding that broadband service would be available to us. I know I live in a rural area of north west Florida, but the technology is available in this area. So why haven't we been subsidized? 
 
Thanks,
Frank Acuff
