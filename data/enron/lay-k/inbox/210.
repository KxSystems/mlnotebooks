Dear Gil.

First of all, I wish to thank you for the recent e-mails you have sent me.
In the case of the one below, I would like to know weather are there some
exporters of US goods and services which we may contact to offer the
services of NAFIN under the Guarantee Program of EXIMBANK. As you may be are
aware, we have concluded a Master Guarantee Agreement with EXIM through
which NAFIN is able to obtain a guarantee on the loans extended by it to
Mexican importers of US goods and services.

I will appreciate your feed back on this matter.

Thank you in advance.

Sincerely,

Luis Hern?ndez Santana

November 15 when they depart for Monterrey, and then returns back to Denver
