Ken,

After numerous efforts to secure an audience with President Fox, we have
been successful in scheduling a lunch with him on the 27th of June.  In
addition to our usual reasons for taking this very important one-day
trip, I have been advised by Presidencia (equivalent for our "West
Wing") that during this face-to-face meeting, we would have the
appropriate opportunity to invite President Fox to visit Houston.  I
have just received written confirmation of the 2:30 p.m. luncheon
meeting.  I will be going to appropriate GHP Boardmembers and major
investors to determine who would be available to participate.   I wanted
to give my leadership heads up and request any thoughts or ideas that
you may have on this subject matter as well as to determine your
availability.

Regards,

Miguel
