Dear Dr. Lay--
	
	Thank you for your presentation yesterday.  As always, you handled very well some tough questions in a very trying time for Enron.  I was literally mortified when I heard the "crack" question-- but I think you handled that well too.  As a 17-year Enron veteran, the question made me truly ashamed to be associated with the co-worker who asked the question.  Hindsight is always 20/20.  I'm sure you must know that the majority of Enron's employees don't feel the same way as this one individual.  

Thanks for your continued hard work and support.

Kevin Hyatt
