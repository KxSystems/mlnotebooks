Hello everyone,
Mrs. Lay is taking inventory and organising her
furniture.  She has asked me email everyone with the
request for everyone to photogragh all furniture that
is not your own.  This means that if you have any of
hers or your fellow siblings furniture she would luike
a photo for our records by the 12th of October.
I have a digital camera or a polaroid that you can
borrow.  If you have no foriegn furniture please reply
with a "Nope, Don't have any!" by friday October 5th.

Also on a side note, Please be on time for the family
dinner on the 12th of October.  We will be taking the
kiddy christmas shot before dinner.
