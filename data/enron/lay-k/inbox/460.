We are the Wealthiest Latin American Consumers in the Western Hemisphere

HEINRICH HISPANIDAD:  YOUR CONNECTION TO THE HISPANIC MARKET!

U. S. Hispanics have nearly $452 billion in spending power.  But general

segment with a marketing strategy that hits the target.  As one of the
premier direct response agencies in the U. S., we offer measurable results
for international and national clients across all lines of business.  We can
help you turn names into customers.

Tap into this market today.  Contact Laura Sonderup, Director of U. S.
Hispanic Marketing, at 1.8000.356.5036, Ext. 235 or e-mail lsonderup@
