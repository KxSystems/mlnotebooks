Dear Ken: 
Second, I want to give you a"heads-up" on a memo to the ACCF board of directors wich will arrive shortly by mail.  Both ACCF and some members of its board have been mentioned in the press around the country in connection with Enron, David Duncan (one of our directors), and you.  In addition, last week the Wall Street Journal name me as a board member in 1999, although as you know I retired in May of that year.   
I wanted our directors to know how Mark Bloomfield and I have tried to handle a substantial number of calls from the press.  I have talked with no reporters and Mark has, I think, handled the few he has talked with very well. 
Harmolyn and I and are praying for you in these temendously difficult and agonizing times. 
                                                                                    Charly
