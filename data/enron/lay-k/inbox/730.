Dear Kenneth,
=20
    Sorry to have to bother you at  this time.. But maybe this is just what=
 you need. And if things work out, please  consider a meeting with me to ta=
lk about a job.
    First get you and your crew in  front of that camera, preferably also s=
urround yourself with alot of employees.  And let the world know that Enron=
 is not going to roll over! I just talked to  you secretary, nice lady! BTW=
, she has my number.. And I see that your employees  still believe in your =
company.
    Second, do like Lee Iaiccoa did  with Chysler. Take your pay down to $1=
.00 for next year pending on how well  Enron recovers. Also ask you employe=
es to take a pay cut by 50% for the next  couple of weeks effective today. =
Also make yourself and you top people available  to get the world markets t=
o give you the room you need to be able to conduct  business. AND you know =
the rest.. I am sure you have some really sharp minds at  Enron.. PUMP the =
the emplyees up about doing whatever they can do to bring you  all back fro=
m disaster! AND MOST IMPORTANT!  KEEP EVERYTHING PUBLIC! No  matter what.. =
 Also when you get time go around to everyone you can in the  company and a=
poligize, but most of all encourage them to keep up their good  work. You p=
robably already know good leaders lead by example. Now is sure the  time of=
 you life to make the difference and changes you and your people need to  d=
o. When the dust clears, and I sure hope it does. Take time to get a more  =
personal relationship with all you people, even the lowliest ones. If you t=
hink  far enough back its' the quality of the little guy that makes the  di=
fference.  On closing, I just got this feeling I know you can make the  dif=
ference. May God bless you. And don't be afraid to ask for his help.   Gods=
peed to you and yours.

P.S. when things settle down, I REALLY know how to  make the broadband thin=
g work! No joke.. I quit one of the first big DSL  companies cause of bs'in=
g customers.
P.S.S Feel free to call me anytime  313.336.5047
