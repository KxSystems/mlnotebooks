Dear Mr. Lay,

Thank you for you leadership during our "crisis".  You have demonstrated strength, character, and integrity so far, and I am certain that you will continue to do so.  We all need you.

You have many people praying for you.  Even within our own walls at Enron, there are several Bible Studies that occur throughout the week.  We have already lifted you up in prayer and will continue to do so.

During this trying time, please do not become so weary that you forget where and who your source and strength come from.  The Lord is there to give you comfort, peace, love, and strength.  You are His child. Seek His face and let your dependency be on Him.  He will not fail you.  He never does.

I know that you are a busy man so I will keep this short.

Our prayers are with you.
Your sister in Christ,
Sonya Gasdia
