Ken,
 
Just wanted to see if you had a chance to review my  email from two weeks ago.  If so, I wanted to know if you would consider  supporting our efforts.  I welcome any questions you may have.  I look  forward to hearing from you.
 
I hope you are doing well.  Take  care.
 
Jim

Ken,
 
 
It was a pleasure meeting you on the panel at the Fortune CEO Forum on  Philanthropy and then seeing you again at Davos.  That was my first  time at Davos and it was quite a privilege and experience for me. 
 
I am sending you some info on SeaChange because I wanted to see  if you will consider supporting our efforts.
 
I know you heard what SeaChange does when you and I were on the panel,  but I have attached some documents, like our 2-page Fact Sheet, our FAQs and  our strategic partnerships, so you can see what has transpired.   
 
I have more information which I can send, but I did not want to bombard  you with any more attachments.  Also, we go live on our website on August  28, but if you want to take a look at the beta site,  it is http://beta.sea-change.org .
 
 
I hope you will observe that we have been successful at developing our  partnerships, our staff, our Board of Directors and Board of Advisors, our  selection criteria for social entrepreneurs, our recruitment process and our  technology.  We have worked hard and patiently and are now poised to  officially launch SeaChange.
 
As for the financials, you will see that we were  successful in raising funds beyond the initial few funders, we stayed under  budget and spent according to our means.  However, because our burn rate  is significantly higher as we ramp up for our Preview Period (beginning August  28) and our Launch (October), we need more support.  
 
I hope that you find this  report informative and that you are encouraged by our progress.  If you  should have any questions please let me know.
 
I hope you are doing well too.  I look  forward to hearing from you.  Thanks and have a great  weekend.
 
Jim
