Mr. Lay, as an employee and a stock holder of  Enron, I'm very concerned with what's going on within our company.  I have  always been very positive about Enron and very supportive of the management,  however I truly believe that when Mr. Skillings was made CEO of the company the  investment community lost interest in our company.
 
I know you can't tell me where the stock will be in  12 to 18 months but it would be some re-assurance to hear from you.
