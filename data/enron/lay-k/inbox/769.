Good evening Mr. Lay:

I just wanted to give you a positive note on my behalf.  I really don't kno=
w if you will read this, but if you do I wish you all the best with Enron. =
 I don't know if I'm one of those employees who will be laid off, but on th=
e good side of things:  I respect you profoundly.  I know that you are look=
ing for your employees best interest.  I just wanted to say that I'm proud =
to be an Enron employee and no matter what I will always be proud to have w=
orked under you.  Again I wish the company the best and I hope that one day=
 Enron can be on the top like we were.  I also wanted to say that I will al=
ways be happy to come back and join our wonderful team.  I haven't work her=
e very long, but I liked what Enron did for their people and I respect Enro=
n entirely.  I know that Enron will rise again one day and I hope to be abl=
e to join our great family again.  I just wanted to make sure that you knew=
 that someone out their is proud of what you are doing and respects your ef=
forts.  I hope that you are positive and standing proud of your success wit=
h the company.  I will always be proud.  Thank you for all your help and ef=
forts.  I appreciate everything...  Take care Mr. Lay and May God always gu=
ide you through these hard times.  I know that you will make the right deci=
sion for Enron.  Again I just want to send you a positive note, instead of =
all those negative emails that you have been receiving.  I just wanted to m=
ake sure that you knew that someone still believes in what you created.
