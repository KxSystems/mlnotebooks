Dear Ken,
        Having been  deeply involved at the birth of Enron I,in a very insignificant
way,share the immense pain you certainly feel.The only  conceivable solace
comes from The Course in Miracles which tells us that "we  are as God created
us" and the Bible which says "this too will pass".You and all  the Enron family 
are in Pat and my prayers.
        As you are obviously  deciding on all crucial corporate and personal matters
at this critical time please, if at all possible,look  favorably at my previously sub-
mitted formal request to receive the discounted lump sum  distribution of my retire-
ment funds authorized under the 1994 Deferral Plan.At this  most difficult time I 
greatly appreciate your attention to this  request.
                                                                            Respectfully  Submitted,
                                                                             Lou Potempa
