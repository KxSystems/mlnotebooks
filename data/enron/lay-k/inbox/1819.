I have had the upmost respect for you since joining Enron and it was reaffirmed with your message today.  I don't agree with your decision to give the money back but I think it speaks volumes as to your character.  Good luck wherever you go and thanks for the leadership you have provided Enron.

Sincerely, 

Mike
