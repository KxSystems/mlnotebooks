I have found the events of the last two months to  be among the most unsett=
ling in my 15 years of owning stock in public  companies.  I have sold my 1=
,800 shares of Enron Corp. because I no longer  have faith in the board to =
be a good watchdog for the best interests  of the shareholders.  I just don=
't understand how senior managers can  manipulate the financial results of =
the company for the past five years and only  recently be discovered.  I ex=
pect the board to act as more than a lap-dog  for senior management.  I am =
encouraged you turned down the chance to  accept a $60 million payday for t=
his merger that salvages what little  shareholder value remains in Enron.  =
I would expect the board to seek  repayment of any and all bonuses paid to =
senior managers based on these  inaccurate financial results, including the=
 estimated $30 million paid to the  CFO, who allegedly is the architect of =
this scheme to defraud  stockholders.  Had I known the company was apparent=
ly built on smoke and  mirrors, I would have sold my stock long ago and not=
 be forced  to watch my  children's college fund be pocketed by executives =
who have little regard for the  stockholders they were hired to serve.  I g=
uess the only lesson I can take  from this is that no company, no matter ho=
w large or prestigious is safe from  dishonest management.  I do not includ=
e you in this group, but I do believe  you and the board bear some blame fo=
r allowing this happen for the past five  years.
