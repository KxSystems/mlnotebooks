Mr. Lay,

I know you are extremely busy so I will keep this short.  Do you have any
contacts with ABN AMRO or BANC One in Chicago?  They are building new
offices and I know I would qualify to do something even short term.  Can you
provide to me a few contacts to get in the door, please....?  Any contacts
in Chicago would be great.

If you need to verify my performance with ECS please contact Lance Jameson.
I was a Project Manager for the Network and relocation activities.

Respectfully,
Phil Krueger
