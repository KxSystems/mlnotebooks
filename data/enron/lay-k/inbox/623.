Dear Joannie,

The ornament is fantastic and very appropriate this year.  We will need to
get an exact head count for the Enron order.  The corporate secretary
usually gives me an exact directors list and then Ken is the one that
decides which of his executives are invited to the dinner and Rosie provides
me with a list.

Additionally, I would like 15 ornaments for my personal use that I would
like to get ordered ASAP.  Is your source giving you a discount and if so,
how much?  I have several sources for getting discounts on most items,
including Radko ornaments, that I use every year.  Let's compare prices.
Thank you.  Linda

I had a vendor send this to me.  It is a special Radko ornament he
designed in remembrance of the recent disasters in NY and Washington.
The proceeds from the sell of this are going to the relief efforts.  I
thought it might be of interest to you as a possible holiday gift.  The
cost is around $30.  The problem is, we would need to reserve some by
this Friday.  I'm happy to coordinate one consolidated order if this is
of interest.  Please get back to me ASAP and let me know.  Thanks.

Holiday 2001
   <<...OLE_Obj...>>

Christopher Radko "Brave Heart" ornament.  They are donating the
proceeds of
this ornament to the Relief Fund of the American Red Cross in NY.  Are
you
interested in ordering these for holiday this year.  We can imprint your
logo and a message on the hang tag as we did last year.


Please let me know, they are in production on these to make the holiday
delivery schedule.  They need orders asap.

I hope things are going ok for you.  It has been such a horrible week
for us
all.  It is very hard to push forward and past this.

Regards,

Diane Murphy
