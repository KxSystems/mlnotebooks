  "ELECTRICITY MARKET RESTRUCTURING: REFORMS OF REFORMS"=20
Abstract:  Electricity systems present complicated challenges for public po=
licy.  In many respects these challenges are similar to those in other netw=
ork industries in providing a balance between regulation and markets, publi=
c investment and private risk taking, coordination and competition.  As wit=
h other such industries, naturally monopoly elements interact with potentia=
lly competitive services, but electricity has some unusual features that de=
fy simple analogy to other network industries.  Following a reversal of a l=
ong-term decline in real electricity prices, the last two decades of the tw=
entieth century were for the United States a time of reform, reaction, and =
reforms of reforms in electricity systems, moving slowly towards greater re=
liance on competition and markets. Changing technology, new entrants in the=
 generation market, and a legislative mandate to provide access to the esse=
ntial transmission facility accelerated a process that required major innov=
ations in institutions and operations. Complete laissez faire competition i=
s not possible, and the details of an efficient competitive electricity mar=
ket are neither obvious nor easy to put in place. The benefits of reform ma=
y be substantial, but they require careful attention to market design. A re=
view of the past identifies some choices on the road ahead.
