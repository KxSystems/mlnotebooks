ARTICLES AND PAPERS

"MPLS Branches Out - It's more than a non-ATM way to engineer the
core."
September 2001 - Telecommunications Magazine
Excellent article by Sam Masud, Senior Technology Editor
http://www.integralaccess.com/press_news57.htm

New White Paper Available ...
"MGCP Implementation in the Access Gateway"
Is it better to implement MGCP in a line access gateway at the
customer premise (e.g. in an Integrated Access Device) or in a line
access gateway at an Access Aggregation point (e.g. an edge router)?
While there are claims of advantages and disadvantages for each
alternative, invariably, a combination of technical and economic
factors associated with each alternative will prove the final market
positioning.

aggregation devices for central offices, co-locations, points of
presence, PurePacketCompact for multi-tenant units (MTU), and the
