Dear Mr. Lay,

I am sure no one could imagine the worry and mental
anguish you have had to endure these past weeks.  I
pray for you that you will continue to have the
strength to move forward during these trying times.

Mr. Lay, I'm really a "nobody".  I started my career
back in 1972 with Northern Petrochemical in Morris
Illinois.  I worked there for two years then quit to
return to college to earn my engineering degree.  I
graduated in 1979 at the age of 29.  Upon graduation,
I hired back with Northern Natural Gas in Liberal
Kansas.  I continued my career with Enron until
January 15 this year.  I had been expat with EE&CC
until Nov. 14, 2000.  When I returned to Houston, I
found out that I had been "redeployed".  To my
disappointment, I was unable to find another position
and was severed on Jan. 15, 2001.  As you can imagine,
by saving my money, working hard, and receiving stock
options, I had accumulated enough money to go ahead
and retire.  I was feeling good about my career, my
life with Enron, the years of sacrificing time and
effort for the betterment of the company.  (You know,
in spite of what's happened since Jan. 15, I still
feel good about all the years I dedicated to the
company.)  You know what else, I still have the upmost
respect and confidence in you.  I really hope your
self confidence is not slipping.  You've accomplished
great things with this company.  You can continue to
lead us through these trying times.  I know you can!

In closing, I just want to say "thanks".  Thanks for
being our leader all these years.  Thanks for the
"wild ride" we've all shared since 1985.  I wouldn't
trade it for the world.  Please know that there are
many of us "nobody" people out here that still wish
you well, pray for you, and hope something positive
will surface in the near future.

Daniel Junk

P.S.  I know the Fed. Gov. loaned Chrysler billions a
few years back when they were against the ropes.  The
emphasis was on saving 200,000 or 300,000 jobs.
Wouldn't they do the same for Enron, considering all
the people whose retirements are dependent upon
Enron's performance?  Not just former employees, but
all investors?
