Congressman Sessions will be on Channel 4 tonight at 5:00 pm
CST, this is the Fox station in the Dallas/Ft. Worth area.  He
will be discussing a federal oversight plan declared today, November
9, 2001, that Amtrak will not meet a congressional deadline for
achieving financial self-sufficiency, a finding that forces Amtrak
to draw up a plan for its own liquidation.
