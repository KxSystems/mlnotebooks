Mr. Lay.... 
If you are representative of Christianity....  then obviously Jesus was an evil man.  With what you did to energy consumers and your employees through your sick, sick greed.   
But Jesus is not evil, and you are not a Christian. When Jesus said "There will be many who call me Lord! Lord!, but they will be cast out of heaven, for they never knew me"... he was talking about YOU.

PS  Hopefully you are NOT representative of Christianity.
