"MGCP Implementation in the Access Gateway"
Is it better to implement MGCP in a line access gateway at the
customer premise (e.g. in an Integrated Access Device) or in a line

alternative, invariably, a combination of technical and economic
factors associated with each alternative will prove the final market
positioning.
