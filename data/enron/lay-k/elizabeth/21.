I got the message that we are headed for Zurich for the WWF meeting in 
November.  This is a very delicate situation in that WWF will use whatever 
you say, even the hint of the slightest committement, against Enron in the 
future. As you know, I have found this group the most dishonest, back 
dealing  NGO I have ever dealt with.When Shell has these meetings, they have 
my counterpart meet ahead of time with the the WWF top staff person and work 
out an agenda. For example, you will have to be throughly briefed on the 
Bolivian situation before we go in.  I also would find it counter productive 
to include any of the low level WWF staff that went to this meeting when 
Shell held it last.   Remember, this is the group that publicly announced 
that Enron has gotten away with murder for years and we are going to get 
them.  They also have te goal of wanting to lock us up in a world wide 
partnership. This is the last groupo I would do this with.

I guess this is a long way of saying that we need to go in their well 
prepared with our eyes wide open. Did you commit to any agenda when you set 
up the meeting? I will contact their staff and see what they want to discuss 
and when I get back to the states, I start pulling materials together.
