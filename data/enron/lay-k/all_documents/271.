Ken-Here is a first cut at a spread sheet for the distributions necessary to
return at lease $100,000 to everyone so no partner will have to put up any
new money.  Have you heard from Texaco or BFI? Also, Marathon committed to
the roll over, but not the referendum.  You may need to make a call to
Marathon to see if you can convince them on the referendum.  Conoco also
only committed to their proportionate part, probably about $50,000, for the
referendum and Don Sanders said he would commit $50,000 toward the
referendum.  We, therefore could have only $1 million from the partners on
the referendum if Marathon, Texaco and BFI don't contribute.  We do have
$100,000, however, from Reliant.  Moreover, without Sanders, BFI and
possibly Texaco, we may have only around $30 million to rollover into the
loan.  As soon as we can the final answers from all of the partners we will
be able to finalize the term sheet with the Sports Authority and get the
advance payment on the loan.  I still haven't heard from Goldberg on the
term sheet with the Rockets.
