The Houston Association of Realtors Board of Directors voted to support both
the Downtown Arena Referendum and Proposition 2012.   An e-mail greeting I
composed is being sent today to 6500 members of HAR with e-mail addresses to
encourage them to vote for the Arena, Proposition 2012, and HAR's
recommended candidates.  Sue Walden approved the message earlier today and
gave me your e-mail address.  Click below to see and hear HAR's greeting.  I
hope you like it!
