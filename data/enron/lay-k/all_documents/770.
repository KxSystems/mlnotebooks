Just a heads up from a Business Coalition for Clean Air (BCCA) meeting we had 
on Monday to try to raise the proposed $1.6 million for 2001 activities.  
(You will hear all about the business plan today.)

The suggested amount for you/Enron is $200,000--12.5% of the total.  Enron 
gave $50,000 for the 2000 effort, which was about 8% of the total they ended 
up raising ($617,000).   it is your call on what is reasonable, and keep in 
mind there might be another round later on.

We have been working on a list of potential donors with "A" being the 
impacted such as refiners and petrochemical companies and "B" being 
beneficiaries such as contractors.  Ned Holmes office suggested that you pick 
the names of the potential donors for the Enron visit and he will just take 
the rest.  The list is being updated, so we will have to wait until the 
meeting to look at it.
