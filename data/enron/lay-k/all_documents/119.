Hello Janice:

 I enjoyed your recent e-mail but was sorry to hear about your dad.  It 
sounds as though his health has deteriorated significantly.  These are always 
difficult times.  As I watched my mother and father's health deteriorate and 
ultimately watched them die, it is a very defining time in our lives.  But we 
can be very thankful to have such great parents and to have been privilege to 
be raised in such loving homes.

 Sounds as though Eric has done very well as SMSU.  He is joining an 
excellent company.  I am also delighted to hear that he will continue his 
education working toward an MBA.  As we are living in an age were 
intellectual capital is so valuable, it is important for every young person 
to obtain the very best possible education they can.  As to our family, 
within the last ten days our youngest daughter Elizabeth was married to a 
young man from Buenos Aires, Argentina.  They met while they were both 
working on a project as lawyers in Buenos Aires.  They're currently on their 
honeymoon but shortly after returning will be moving from Buenos Aires to 
Miami, Florida.  This past Thursday night our sixth grandchild was born.  It 
was born to our son David and his wife Courtney.  It was a 7 lb., 10 oz.,  20 
inch little boy.  So we now have three grandsons and three granddaughters 
ranging from about 2 years - 4 months down to a few days.  They are a great 
deal of fun.  We are doing quite well.  I am looking forward to seeing Ginger 
"Rees" Copeland when she comes to Houston.  I would be delighted to arrange 
tickets for you and your family should you ever have occasion to visit 
Houston.

 I hope you have a great summer.
