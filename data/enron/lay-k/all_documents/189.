I would like to schedule a short meeting in your office to  share the 
remarkable progress that the Committee to Encourage Corporate  Philanthropy 
is making and to ask that you consider hosting a meeting for  ten to fifteen 
CEOs of other major Houston corporations to encourage their  participation in 
the only forum of CEOs focused on the agenda of corporate  giving.
?
I'm anxious to meet you as we have so many friends in  common: three of your 
directors, John Duncan, Pug Winokur and Norm Blake, and  the Slocums, to name 
just a few.
?
I look forward to hearing from you.
?
?
P.S. If it works in your schedule, I'm available to come  to Houston on 
August 28 or 29 or anytime the week of September  4.
