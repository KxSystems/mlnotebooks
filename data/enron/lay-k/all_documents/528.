Dear Mr. Lay,

Further to my emails dated 22/2/2000 & 14/6/2000 introducing Tata Housing  =
as=20
a premium real estate developer in India, and specifically, our commercial =
=20
complex Technopolis KnowledgePark at Andheri (E), Mumbai. We have been give=
n=20
to  understand that Enron have acquired an additional space in Kamla Mills=
=20
Compound.  We were surprised to note that Enron did not consider Technopoli=
s=20
KnowledgePark  inspite of it being a ready to move in building with all the=
=20
facilities required  for a good Call Center.

A few of these facilities being -

?High speed (100 MBPS) data network with switched interconnection  between=
=20
offices.
?Provision for ISDN lines.
?5000 line MTNL exchange on campus
?Power from Tata Electric Cos, which is 20% cheaper than the  Government=20
supply.
?In addition, a good quality restaurant and 24 hours ATM  facility.
?Central Air-conditioning & Building Automation System.

All these facilities and more were explained to Mr. Edward de Valcourt, =20
Project Director Communications, Enron Corp., when he visited Technopolis =
=20
KnowledgePark on 16/6/2000. Inspite of that, we have once again not been =
=20
considered. I would like to take this opportunity to inform you that we =20
currently have approximately 1,00,000 sq.ft. of space available at=20
Technopolis  KnowledgePark. We are also in the process of constructing the=
=20
IInd Phase in the  same complex which is approximately 60,000 sq.ft. and ca=
n=20
be made entirely  available to you, if required.

Further, we have another building of approximately 1,00,000 sq.ft. located =
=20
strategically at Kanjurmarg. This too could be ideal for your requirement.=
=20
We  would also like to inform you that Tata Housing has a large land bank a=
nd=20
can  offer properties to Enron for Call Centres across the country.=20

We request you to once again look into the same and revert to us at the =20
earliest.

Thanking you

Yours sincerely,
