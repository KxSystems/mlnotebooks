Here in my group, and all over Enron, I see people working hard while some 
even go above and beyond.  I am in my mid-thirties and will speak for so many 
in saying THANK YOU for your hard work, great planning and sacrifice made in 
the early years long before we came here to enjoy all the extra benefits 
provided.   My family and I, along with so many others, appreciate the 
rewards you provide for hard work.  There is no way we can say it enough.

Thanks again,
Corry Bentley
