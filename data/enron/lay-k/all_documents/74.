Hi Terry -

Ken Lay said that he would really like an update and more detail about the 
"Digital Divide" and TFA.  He is attending the Fortune Battle Royal and said 
this fits right in with the subject.  He will be leaving for Washington 
tomorrow night.

Thanks.

Rosalee

Dear Ken:

Night before last I visited with President and Mrs. Bush and suggested that he
give you a call regarding TFA (Technology For All)! I told him that it might
prove valuable for his son's campaign!  When we spoke with Cynthia Sandherr in
Washington a week or so ago, she said that the "Digital Divide" was the 
hottest
topic on Capital Hill.  She had some wonderful ideas on how to spin this so 
that
businesses create the bridge for the divide and not government!  Although we
want to stay nonpartisan with TFA, this would be a wonderful press opportunity
and platform in Washington!

Just thought I should give you "heads-up" in case he asks and please tell 
Linda
I said hello!

Thank you for doing so much for the cause!
