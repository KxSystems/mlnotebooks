Dear Mr.Lay,

I hope this email finds you looking forward to the approching holiday
season. I thought I would take this opportunity to drop you a quick email
and express my interest in Enron for my future. My name is Dulari Mehta and
we first met at the Davenport Society Dinner in October at the University of
Missouri-Columbia. I was escorting Mr. Walker and I was sitting at your
table. I again had a chance to speak with you at the Mosaic Society Dinner
in November. On both occasions I enjoyed speaking with you and exchanging
ideas about India.

As this semester closes and I begin to plan my next one, I am looking at
opportunites that await me once I graduate in May of 2001. I have spent some
time looking at your website and I am very intersted in Enron as a possible
place to work. I am especially interested in your project management area
and/or international opportunities. I have attached my resume to this email.
I would love to hear from you as to your thoughts on my resume and a
possible future at Enron.

All my current and permanent contact information is on my resume. I will be
out of the country and in India from December 22 to January 13. I hope you
and your family have a wonderful holiday season. I very eagerly await
hearing from you.

Thank you for you time and consideration,
Dulari Mehta
