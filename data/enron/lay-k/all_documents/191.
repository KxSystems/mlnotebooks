Dear Ken,
 I have been told that you will not have time to meet with me, prior to Mr 
Fox dinner in New York.
I have to be in N.Y., anyhow, so let me know if you feel like having a night 
cap, after your dinner.

 Here is some relevant information regarding the participants at the dinner 
and their interests in Mexico.

 Best regards, jaime____
