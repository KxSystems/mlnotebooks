______ 

Today, the Senate voted 65 to 32 in favor of a motion by Senator Roth to 
table the Thompson-Torricelli amendment.? Other amendments remain, but this 
motion removes the last significant obstacle to the passage of Permanent 
Normal Trade Relations for China.? A lot of hard work went into defeating 
this amendment.? Congratulations to all involved.? We look forward to a 
passage of a clean bill for China PNTR by Tuesday of next week.
