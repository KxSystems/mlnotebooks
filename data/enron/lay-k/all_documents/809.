From CNN Web Site concerning Florida Secretary of  State Deadline.


In a morning news conference, Bob Crawford -- a Democratic member of the 
Florida state canvassing commission, which is charged with certifying the 
statewide vote count -- said there was no getting around the statute cited by 
Harris. 
"It is clear to me that the statute takes away any of my discretion as a 
member of that commission to extend the deadline," Crawford said.
