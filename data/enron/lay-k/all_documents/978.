Hello, Mr. Lay, I thoroughly enjoyed the awards luncheon today, and I 
understand this was your treat to us for having done such a good job.  I'm so 
proud to have been a part of this, and have one more thing to brag on about 
Enron to family and friends.  I hope you and your loved ones have a great 
holiday season.

Sincerely,
Regina Karsolich
