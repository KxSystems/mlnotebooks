Subject: Good-bye

Hi!

Just a quick note to say good-bye and thank you after five and a half years!  
My last day at Enron will be Thursday, August 31st.  I will be heading off to 
two new jobs -- to be a full-time mom once Baby Lee arrives and to start my 
own stationary/invitations company.  

I have thoroughly enjoyed working with all of you.  Thank you for all the 
opportunities you have given me over the years.   For your Community 
Relations needs, Elyse Kalmans is heading up the department.  She can be 
reached at 713.853.0565.

Thanks!
amy
