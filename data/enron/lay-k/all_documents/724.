Good Morning Rosalee,
?
I've attached the following:

the draft letter (Word/mail merge format) for Mr.  Lay's review (Lay Enron 
Houston) - as I mentioned, he may personalize it  anyway he sees fit and of 
course you'll need to fill in the blanks with the  specifics.  
the list of Houston companies (Houston Region) Mr.  Moore developed from the 
Fortune 400 list of Houston companies - it is  important that Mr. Lay know he 
should invite any other chief executive/company  in the Houston area that he 
believes would be interested in the Committee's  work.  
the mailing list (Houston mailing list) which  includes phone numbers for 
follow up calls if necessary.  
our most recent rosters of board members and committee  members.

Once you have additional Houston companies, I'll be glad  to help with 
names/addresses/phone numbers. 
?
I'll FedEx to you our brochures to include with the  letter/invitation. If 
you have any questions or need our assistance in anyway  please do not 
hesitate to call me. Thanks again for all your help.
?
Christine Cusack
Committee to Encourage Corporate Philanthropy

P.S. Mr. Newman has confirmed that he will attend. I don't  have confirmation 
from Mr. Derr's office yet - I'll let you  know.
