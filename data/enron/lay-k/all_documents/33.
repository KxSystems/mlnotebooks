Mr. Lay,  I have received the proposal from Gulstream and will drop it off 
today.  As you probably already know, the flight from Beijing was a record 
first for the GV into Houston.

I have met and discussed the possibility of the GV replacing a 900B or a 
total fleet transition at length with John Stabler, Ron Fain and Keith 
Jones.  I have prepared a spread sheet showing the affect on budget as well 
as our thoughts and recommendations.
  
Although the cabin size of the Global Express is larger, Gulfstream is a good 
two years ahead of the Global in deliveries and fleet size.  They have 
overcome the mechanical problems that were experienced earlier in the 
program,  problems that  the Global Express may still be facing.  Worldwide 
support and operational experience have the Gulfstream far ahead of the 
Global Express.
  
Bombardier is still looking forward to demonstrating their aircraft to you on 
your India trip in December.

All of us at the department stand ready to do whatever you feel necessary to 
support Enron into the new millennium.
