We are trying to set up a brief meeting of the HR Committee meeting on
Thursday or Friday to look at the compensation package for a new CIO and a
retention package for a current executive officer.

Larry Babbio is out of the office but his assistant has indicated that
Thursday afternoon is likely to be the best time for him.

I'd appreciate your sending your availability for Thursday and Friday.  If
we cannot arrange a meeting, we'd like to schedule a call with each of you
individually and use a unanimous written consent to authorize the
compensation matters.

We appreciate your help and regret the short notice immediately prior to a
holiday weekend.

Thanks,

Linda
