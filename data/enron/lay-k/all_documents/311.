             Eli Lilly and Company Launches Lillydiabetes.com
          New Web Site Designed To Help Patients Manage Diabetes

 Lillydiabetes.com is valuable resource for the 16 million Americans with
                                 diabetes


Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) has launched lillydiabetes.com (

http://www.lillydiabetes.com), an interactive Web site designed to help the

16 million Americans with diabetes and their families understand and manage

the disease and its complications.  The Web site provides patients

information about diabetes and gives them tools to help manage their

disease.



"Diabetes is a progressive, potentially debilitating disease that requires

regular monitoring of blood sugar, blood pressure and weight, among other

things," said Doug Rude, e-commerce team leader, Eli Lilly and Company.

"Lillydiabetes.com can help empower patients and their families with the

information and tools necessary to manage their disease and live healthier

lives."



Lillydiabetes.com has a number of features and tools to encourage

aggressive management of diabetes.  Because diabetes is a chronic,

progressive disease, it is important that patients closely track their

progress toward better blood-sugar control, as well as the development of

diabetes-related complications. Those who register with the site have

access

to customizable "Measures of Control" tools designed to help patients

monitor their diabetes and the complications that can arise.  The Measures

of Control tools include:



?    HbA1c Chart (blood-sugar control) ? Hemoglobin A1c test measures
average blood-sugar levels over a two to three-month period.  Each time an
HbA1c test is done, patients can enter the value and save it as a color
graph, which then can be used to track the patient's progress toward better
blood-sugar control.
?    Height and Weight Index ? Excess body fat can lead to insulin
resistance, a major factor in the development of type 2 diabetes.  This
tool helps patients calculate their body mass index, which is a measure of
body weight relative to height.  The Web site then provides a place to save
that information and chart progress toward desired weight.


?    Blood Pressure Chart ? A common complication of diabetes is high blood
pressure, which can lead to heart disease as well as signal other
potentially serious problems, such as diabetic kidney disease.  This tool
allows patients to enter their blood pressure levels, save them and chart
their progress.


Other resources found on lillydiabetes.com include:

care, Eli Lilly and Company has developed many products for the treatment

this newsletter, which provides information about the latest diabetes

Patient Check List ? This section provides patients and family members with

a list of issues that should be addressed by their doctor, enabling them to

work with their physician to aggressively manage their disease.



Educational Resources ? Lillydiabetes.com provides information on an array

of diabetes-related topics.  Subject headings include:  About Diabetes,

Diabetes Management, Planning Meals, Diabetes Resources, and Diabetes

Products.



Lilly plans to add new tools and features to the site every 90 days.  The

new features will help equip patients, physicians and other health care

professionals with online tools that improve understanding of the disease

and delivery of care to patients.
