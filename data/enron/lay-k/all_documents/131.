Dear Dad and Mark,
I am attaching the first draft of my resume in hopes
that you may be able to provide suggestions on making
it even better. Also, if you have any ideas on
contacts in Miami for work, that would be great. I am
going to routes in looking for a job, one money, one
love. The money route will be with a law firm or
preferrably a company looking of counsel for
government relations, energy background, etc.  The
second track will be on the more dolphin hugging side
such as marine conservation groups.
Let me know you thoughts.
I love you both,
Liz Vittor
