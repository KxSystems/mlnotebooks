Lewis, Superintendent =01) Tehachapi Operations, responded to a call for he=

from Oak Creek Energy (a local wind power developer located approximately 5=

miles from our Tehachapi facility).  With no more detail than that a man ha=
d=20
sustained serious injury =01) a compound tibia fracture, and was located wi=
thin=20
a NEG/Micon turbine 180 feet above the ground, Dennis, Rick and Mike quickl=
y=20
grabbed their rope rescue gear and arrived at Oak Creek approximately 10-15=
=20
minutes after the call. =20

After a quick assessment by Dennis and the Kern County Fire Department=20
(KCFD), all agreed that Enron Wind=01,s equipment was the most appropriate,=
 and=20
Enron Wind and KCFD would work together as a unit to lead the rescue. =20

While Dennis headed up the tower with local Halls Ambulance paramedics and=

KCFD personnel, Rick and Mike remained on the ground to coordinate the grou=
