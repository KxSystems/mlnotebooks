________________

Dear Mr.Lay:

It's a pleasure to get in contact with you, in order to expose our request.

We are a Reforestation Company from Panama, members of the American Chamber
of Commerce (AMCHAM), the Spanish Chamber of Commerce and the Board of
Director of the Panamanian National Association of Reforestators and we are
constituted for four different groups, with a headquarters in Panama City,
and offices in New York and Miami, in addition to several clothing and shoes
companies in Colon Free Zone, chain of retail stores at Panama City, real
estate, etc.

At present, we have 1200 reforested hectares (1 ha = 2,47 acre) with
teakwood trees. Our program is to extend the plantations, in order to
complete 2000 hectares the next year and 4000/5000 hectares (at least), in
the next 5/8 years with the participation of new investors.

As our strategy, we have in mind to invite new investment groups to
incorporate our projects, through the formation of Joint Ventures for
develope them together, or to start new forestal projects with tropical
species apts for the panamanian type soil. The tropical species have an high
aggregate value in the international market.

Because this, we want to get in contact with your group to invite you to
invest in our forestal projects. We haven't problem with the lands and
dimension of projects.

It's very important to detail, that our project need to be for your group,
part of the environmental corporative strategy in this area (Central
America), due at Panama don't have big extension of lands.

Our company will offer, in this case, the guarantees could be necessary.

Must have in mind, all the advantages existing in Panama, which are:

- Money currency is the U.S.Dollar, which gives stability that few countries
actually have,

- Low internal costs,

- Low annual inflation, which the past 15 years has been 1,3%,

- Strategical geographic position,

- Forestal Law exempts free to tax all profits obtain in Reforestation.

If you have interest in our proposal, we will send you more information
about our company by courrier.

Please, let me know your comments about our request.

Thank you in advance for your attention, we will kindly await for your
response.

Hope to hear from you soon.

Sincerely,

Alberto Mantel
