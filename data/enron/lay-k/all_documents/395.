Dear Dad and Mark,
I am attaching the resume of the lovely and talented
Ms. Amanda Day who, like all wise soon to be graduates
of businees school, is very interested in a position
at Enron.
Of course she would be an incredibly valuable addition
to the Enron team and to Houston. If you have any
questions about her character, achievements, or goals,
please feel free to contact me.
All my love,
Elizabeth
