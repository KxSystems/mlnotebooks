While mid-September was the target date for mailing the Registration Package
for Prague 2001, we are still awaiting registration materials produced in the
Czech Republic.  They are complete; however, not yet shipped!  After 40 years
of Communism, their picture of efficiency is fuzzy.

Our new mailing target date is "within a couple of weeks".

As previously stated, for Cyber List members, the Registration Form will
reach you as an e-mail attachment the same day we mail the Registration
Package from WPO.  Print it - complete it - fax it back to WPO ASAP.

On behalf of the Committee,

John W. Galston
