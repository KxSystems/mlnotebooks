The ch 2 survey had a wider spread but I don't  think it is accurate (63-36).

The Chronicle will be calling tomorrow with their  poll numbers. Their poll 
is a creation of Dick Murray and Bob Stein. I would  expect them to show us 
in a much tighter race. These guys are not always  accurate (remember their 
60-40 against poll on baseball in '96).
