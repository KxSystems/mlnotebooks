What happens next? The answer to this question and more is in the definitiv=

electoral college, the process of presidential succession, and the=20
interactions of the Constitution with federal and state statutes and party=

"The United States has the world's most successful system for selecting a=

chief executive. But Americans are remarkably, and dangerously, unaware of=

how the electoral college came to be what it is. Hence we have long needed =
an=20
explanation of the college--its origins and evolution--as subtle and=20
intelligent as the college itself. That need has now been met by the book=

which combines equal mastery of constitutional law and political philosophy=
