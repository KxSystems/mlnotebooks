Thank you so much.  We are deeply grateful to you.

Dear Dean Walker -

Ken Lay asked me to respond to you re:

1) Naming the new professorship the Pinkney C. Walker Distinguished Teaching
Professorship - this is fine.
2) He will be pleased to serve as the keynote speaker for the banquet on
October 13.

Thanks.

Rosalee
