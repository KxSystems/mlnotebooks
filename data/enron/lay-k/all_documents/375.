I want to advise you that CNBC will launch new on-air graphics that will
allow us to provide additional real-time market data in a quicker, clearer
and more concise manner.

Starting Monday, Oct. 2, CNBC's new graphically enhanced on-air charts will
display real-time volume information as well as pricing information in
decimals.  In addition, CNBC's intra-day charts will now include exact time
references to reinforce the precise moment a stock is being traded.

Please click on the Web link provided below to preview three slides that
illustrate our new on-air look, as it will appear on Oct. 2.

I encourage you to share this information with your organization and welcome
any comments from you or others about these changes, or other aspects of
CNBC coverage.  Comments can be sent to me personally by replying to this
e-mail.

Best regards,

Bill
