Dear Kenneth,

 Hello! I wanted to inform you of an exclusive Delphi Event.  Attached is a 
letter from Tom Koulopoulos, The Delphi Group's CEO, explaining the details 
for our upcoming Executive Retreat to be held on August 28-29 in Aspen. This 
is going to be a truly unique experience.

 I would like to extend you and other senior level executives at Enron an 
invitation to this  event. I have already invited George Short. This event is 
limited attendance since the St. Regis Aspen can only accommodate 200. The 
early registration fee is $2500.00 per seat.

 I will follow up with you later in the week. In the meantime, if you have 
any questions, please e-mail or call me at 617-247-1511.

Best Regards,

Shawn Christy
