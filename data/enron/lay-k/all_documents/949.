Ken/Jeff/Steve:

I thought I would let you know that tonight on the Jim Lehrer Newshour on PBS 
they had a lengthy segment on California power prices.  While I took issue 
with some elements of the story, on balance it was one of the more calm and 
rational stories on the issue I have seen.  It might be worth obtaining a 
transcript to review.
