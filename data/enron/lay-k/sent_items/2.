I fully understand and agree with your comments.  Unfortunately, I did not see the "Travel Secruity Update" e-mail before it was sent out.  We will do better.

Sir,
I read your note with great deal of interest and care.  I was pleasantly surprised to see that this email was devoid of any stereotypical remarks that are so prevalent in the mass media today.

Unfortunately, such is not the case with other communications being sent out on behalf of Enron Corp.  A case in point is the corporate security email, titled 'Travel Security Update', that was send out yesterday.  In this email, reaction to possible U.S. military retaliation has been tied to extremist Islamic violence.  Truth of the matter is that any reaction to the U.S. military action could be because of extreme nationalism, most likely to the be the case, or even extreme regionalism.  References to Islam, extremism, and violence, in the manner used in the security communication only perpetuates the stereotypes.

I would like for you and my co-workers at Enron to know that MUSLIMS DO NOT HATE AMERICANS (regardless of what Frank Graham wants to believe).  Muslims do have deep-rooted disagreements and distrusts of the American foreign policy but that in no way translates to what the mass media  would have us believe.

thanks

As you know, the U.S. government is investigating hundreds, if not thousands, of relatives, acquaintances and associates of the individuals who may have been involved in the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11.  We believe that the media will soon be reporting that one of the many individuals being questioned is an Enron employee in Houston.  It is appropriate for us to withhold judgment and to continue to cooperate fully with federal authorities.  Because this is a matter in the hands of the federal authorities, we cannot provide additional information at this time.   However, we will keep you informed, to the greatest extent possible. 

Please keep in mind that thousands of people who may or may not have any information about the terrorist attacks are being questioned as part of this investigation.  We continue to have every reason to believe that our employees and facilities are safe.  If you have concerns, please call Corporate Security at (713) 345-2804.  If you receive any media or external inquiries about this matter, please call Public Relations at (713) 853-5670.

At Enron, diversity is one of our strengths, and we respect and embrace all people of all faiths and beliefs.  Please continue to keep our employees who have been impacted by this tragedy in your thoughts and prayers.
