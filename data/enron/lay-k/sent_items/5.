Dear  Ken, 
 
This  is the invitation that Harry was speaking to us about on the plane last  night.  Please let me know how to respond.  Note that they did not  mention a starting time.  Rosie may need to call Lee Jamail for  details.  Love, Linda

I called this morning to ask you to dinner with John Martel after the  book 
signing on Sept.12.  It will be very casual.  I do hope you  can make it.  Let 
me know as soon as possible.   Lee and Joe  Jamail
